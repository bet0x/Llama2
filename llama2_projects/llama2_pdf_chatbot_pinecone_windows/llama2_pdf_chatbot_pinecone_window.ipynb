To answer your question. In general we don\\'t\\nsupport forward biasing of diodes in our technologies unless specifically stated such as Schottky\\ndiodes. Mostly this is because the diode model parameters are chosen such that the reverse operation\\nof the diode can be accurately simulated. This does not mean that the simulation of the diodes in\\nforward direction is totally wrong, but it can be less accurate. To model a diode in forward direction\\noften requires parameters that are not available in the model or are insufficiently supported. You can\\nsimulate in forward direction and you will get a typical diode characteristic which is fairly accurate in the\\nlow current range but may be less accurate in the high current range (knee current, series resistance).\\nIn some of our documents is the statement that \"forward bias is not modeled\" which is based on this\\nlack of accuracy in the models. The parameters describing the diode in forward bias are also very\\nlayout-specific, so an accurate model for a diode in forward bias would have to be related to a fixed\\nlayout.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, Can you show me on how\\ntospecify an alpha PDK with xkit ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it.

       " Document(page_content=\"design is already in progress ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. for new designs, we\\nrecommend customers always use the latest PDK. For designs in progress when an update is\\nreleased, customers can review the revision notes at which both the changes document for the process\\nspecifications, and the notes in the rev_info.txt files for each EDA package to evaluate if the changes\\nare critical to their design. In principle, we could have rare special cases where we wouldn't accept\\ndesigns based on an older PDK. Bear in mind that at tape-in, our mask tooling team always uses the\\nmost recent runset for DRC, so customers might want to check their designs with the latest runset to\\navoid possible surprises.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, Is there any correlation\\nbetween the deviation of the sheet resistance (RS) of\\nresistors and that of their thermal coefficients TC1\\nand TC2 ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. In case of some resistors,\\nthere seems to be some correlation between the sheet resistance and their temperature coefficients\\nTC1 and TC2. In some other cases the correlation seems to be quite weak.

       " Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, if the X-Fab I/O Input\\noutput libraries support copper wire bonding ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. we do not have any I/O\\nlibraries specifically designed for Cu or Copper bonding. Some customers have reported running into\\nproblems with copper wire bonding but in at least some cases, different customers have used exactly\\nthe same pad structure and one had no problem while the other had issues. This indicates different\\nassembly houses can have quite different bonding parameters, and as copper wire bonding is a\\nharsher process than gold or aluminum bonding, marginalities in the interaction between the process\\nand bonding are more likely to show up. One suggestion is to consider using the thick metal (METTHK)\\nmodule to give the widest bonding margin for assembly and don't use in conjunction with\\ncircuit-under-pad techniques. If thick metal is not or cannot be used, inform your assembly partner of\\nthe top metal thickness.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, what is the differences\\nbetween IO_CELLS and HV_CELLS libraries ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. For 5V application or LV\\napplication, it is normally sufficient to use IO_CELLS*. HV_CELLS are mainly used when none of the\\nIO_CELLS* fit your requirement, such as needing to implement HV ESD protection. Some general\\nremarks on the differences between HV_CELLS and IO_CELLS are that IO library pad cells are\\nprovided as pad-limited or core-limited layouts, support of multiple power rails. They are also complete\\nIO pad cells with input output buffer circuitry, also HV pad cells are provided as block,layouts, and\\nnormally HV ESD protection structures are too big to fit into a LV IO pad cell frame, moreover HV pad\\ncells consist of protection block and bond pad, and usually contain no power rails or HV input output\\nbuffer circuitry and lastly the protection block can be combined with different size bond pads, and it is\\nintended as a starting point for custom HV ESD pad cell designs.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, Why there is MIM\\ncapacitor antenna DRC checks in XH035 ?

For DMIM construction on X035 which\\nresembles the case of two individual single MIMs - no cross coupling routing, we also believe that it has\\nlow impact.

       " Document(page_content=\"programming ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. When instantiating multiple\\ninstances of the same ROM configuration but with different programmings, it is necessary to use the\\n'extended name' option on the front-end compiler so that each separate instance has a unique name.\\nOtherwise, when IP replacement is performed, both instances will be identical. The distinct names will\\nbe used by the backend compiler so that the top cell name of the generated ROM block will be distinct.\\nOtherwise the cal files submitted will be the same with identical top cell names. Then, even though your\\nblackbox cell names are necessarily different, if we were to proceed with the IP replacement, the result\\nwould be all ROMs with the same programming. Thus to ensure each ROM instance will have the\\ndesired programming, generate the front-end data from the compiler using the extended name option to\\nspecify a unique name for each ROM.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me and explain the usage of\\nPage 2 of Safety area ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. Let me clarify a couple of\\ncomments on the datasheet, if power supply interruption during store is impossible then the\\nbackground is that the trim bits for the charge pump are stored in page 2. The trim bits are determined\\nand stored during wafer probe 1. The trim bits control the programming and erase behavior (timing,\\npulses, programming and erase voltage level) of the Store operation. If the trim bits do not have the\\ncorrect value, the endurance and data retention cannot be guaranteed. Any power supply interruption\\n(for example brown-outs) during Store operation could lead to corrupted non-volatile data, because the\\nStore is not executed and finished correctly. Such scenarios are very application dependent. General\\nrecommendation is to store critical data like the trim bits on page 2 during wafer probe and final test and\\ndo no further Store operation to page 2 during the application. If the correct power supply and a correct\\nStore can be guaranteed, storing to page 2 can also be done.

To answer your question. The PDL primitive device\\nlist file is produced from a special LVS run that only extracts a list of the primitive devices (including\\nparasitic devices) present in your layout. The parasitic devices would generally be diodes that are part\\nof the structure of high voltage or isolated transistors. The PDL file is for information only. There have\\nbeen cases in some of our technologies where a primitive device may be superseded by an improved\\nversion, or conceivably some issue under certain operating conditions of a device may have been\\nidentified -- in such cases, our Customer Projects department would use the PDL to check if such\\ndevices are used in a customer's design and make sure the customer is aware of the device's status.

To answer your question. the connection to DIFF\\nprovides a discharge path during manufacture, so its function as an antenna diode doesn't matter which\\ndiode is used. After manufacture, the antenna role is no longer needed, and how the diode could\\nimpact the function of the circuit must dictate which diode is selected.

       " Document(page_content='absolute\\'voltage limits and what it is specify ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. for X-FAB, the absolute\\nvoltage is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a device for a short period of time without\\nsignificant damage. The main reason we phrase it this way is because we can\\'t be sure what the actual\\nstate of the device will be during this period of time. For example, if 7 volts is applied between the\\nsource and drain of a nmos4 device from the xc06 process 7V is the absolute max value for these\\nterminals. We are not specifying what voltage is on the gate or body of the device. If the gate and body\\nwere at 0V, this voltage could probably be held forever. But if the body was at 0V and the gate was at\\n2V, there would be significant hot carrier current to the gate and the device could fairly quickly degrade.\\nSince this is a circuit issue, we have to use the conservative definition. If in your designs you can\\nguarantee that the devices are always off when the maximum voltage is applied, the devices will\\nprobably survive indefinitely. However, please remember that X-FAB will not guarantee this.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me,how I can export from\\nInnovus to GDS without having to use Virtuoso to\\nreplace abstract views with the layout views ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. One can directly write out\\nfrom Innovus to an OA library that has replaced abstract views with layout views \"oaOut ${newlibName}\\n${designName} ${cellName} -autoRemaster -leafViewNames { layout }\". The output library should be\\ndifferent from the Innovus working OA library, as the new library cannot be read back into Innovus\\nbecause all timing views and global settings will have been lost. Our 180nm technology Cadence PDK\\nkernels include support for GDS export from Innovus. The mapping files to be used when streaming\\nInnovus layers to GDS are in the technology library corresponding to your PDK setup code, for example\\n\"$X_DIR/xh018/cadence/v*_*/PDK/IC61/v*_*_*/TECH_XH018_1141/pnr_streamout.map\".

To answer your question. The short answer is that\\nunlike most digital-dominated fabs, we don't have a set menu of split conditions based on fast / typ /\\nslow that customers should choose because in a mixed signal design there is often a lot more than just\\nVt and poly CD that can be critical to the design (but those parameters would normally be sufficient for\\na digital design). Therefore it's normal for a customer to make a specific request on what parameters it\\nis desired to adjust and the relevant fab will review and confirm if that set of corners is possible. The\\nnegotiation would be done through Customer Projects at the relevant fab. Our digital libraries and\\nmemories are characterized in the process fast/slow 3 Sigma range. 3 Sigma production means that\\n99.73% of the delivered wafers are OK in terms of the stable process parameters. The process\\nparameters are monitored with PCM test structures on each wafer. So, if your digital design is DRC,\\nLVS clean and the timing analysis with post layout extraction is OK at the conditions as follow: 1). PVT\\n= wp(fast), VDD_max, Tj_min 2). PVT = ws(slow), VDD_min, Tj_max then you can expect 99.73% yield\\nof the digital block in terms of process parameter deviations. The majority of our customers don't ask for\\ncorner lots for their projects, but some customers do it. The Vt and gate length adjustments implied by\\nyour proposed corners impact the relevant transistor parameters for digital timing which are saturation\\ncurrent and threshold voltage. The usual flow for ordering corner lots begins with the customer\\nidentifying the critical process parameters for their design (might not be simply 'digital' parameters) and\\nsubmitting a list of required corners (must conform to the PCM pass/fail parameters) to X-FAB. The\\nfeasibility of such process variations will be checked by X-FAB (Customer Projects team) and then a\\nfinal corner split proposal is sent. The goal of such a corner should be to evaluate that the design would\\nwork at lower and upper spec limits. So the typical values are the upper and lower limits of the PCM\\nAcceptance Specification (PAS). Here are some comments that have been collected from one of our\\nFSEs. If you design according to the design rules, then the simulations should be sufficient. Some\\nproducts require that the design rules be pushed to meet the performance requirements. In these\\ncases, corner lots can identify process sensitivities where yield can be compromised. I would estimate\\nthat less than 10% of my customers are relying on Corner Lots for characterization, and these are\\ngenerally only for high-volume products. When they do request they typically look at simple VTN/VTP,\\nmaybe HiRes Poly. The parameters are really design dependent. Even when I do get customers\\nrunning corner lots, I'm not getting much feedback and request for product specific parametric\\ntargeting. This leads to my perception about the accuracy of the simulations. Potentially more effective\\nthan corner lots is coordinating a yield feedback loop once products are released to production.

We can work with you to review your\\nWafer/Final Test and coordinate the best means for yield feedback. One of our application engineers\\nexpanded on those comments, The customers that do request corner lots usually settle on +/-3 sigma\\nfor the parameters they are interested in. The LV MOS VT parameters are usually selected. Beyond\\nthat it really depends on the specifics of the process options the customer has chosen and the\\nsensitivities their designers are most concerned with. However, there are some significant limitations on\\nwhat parameters can be varied cleanly in a corner split. The LV MOS VT parameters are relatively\\nstraight forward because there is usually a separate VT adjust implant used on them that is separate\\nfrom the well implant that controls breakdown and punch through, however there are usually a few\\ninteractions that cant be avoided (like output resistance and nw sheet resistance). The high sheet\\nresistance poly resistors are generally easy to vary because there is usually a dedicated implant for that\\nparameter. Beyond that things get more difficult. The HV transistor VT is sometimes split but there is\\nalmost always an interaction with transistor BVDSS, punch through, sometimes field threshold and\\noften other parameters which can complicate evaluating the split. Other parameters are very difficult or\\nexpensive to split such as gate oxide thickness or capacitor values because they require dedicated\\ndiffusion or deposition runs that use the capacity of five or 6 lots for each split. My background is\\nprocess development and I used to be a big fan of corner splits and ran a lot of them myself. I\\neventually concluded that they were not that useful for three reasons as follow: 1). Too often there are\\nparameter interactions that you cannot avoid which makes it difficult to impossible to get clean results\\nfrom the splits. 2). You may plan for nominal, +3 sigma and -3 sigma splits but due to normal process\\nvariation you usually end up with each of these splits +/- 1 sigma or so from your intended target, e.g.\\n-1 sigma, +2 sigma and -4 sigma, which again makes analysis difficult or impossible and may result in\\nsome splits being non-functional. * The corner splits are arranged by artificially varying one process\\nparameter, such as the VT implant. In actual production lots each device parameter varies 'naturally'\\ndue to the interaction of several different process parameters. Each of these parameters has a different\\nmagnitude and direction impact on several different device parameters, usually for several different\\ndevices. As a result multiple device parameters tend to vary in a complex but related way. The corner\\nsplit procedure does not reproduce this pattern so while you may get the target parameter to vary the\\nway you want, the other device parameters will vary in a completely different way than you will see in\\nactual production lots. For digital blocks this is probably not an important issue but for analog or RF\\nblocks it may give a completely misleading result. I hope this input is helpful in your decision-making.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, if X-FAB processes be\\nused at cryogenic temperatures?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

But if the operating\\nconditions get closer to the electrical limits the probability of malfunction or damage increases. Each\\nMOS transistor consists of a parasitic bipolar transistor.

In principle it might be possible for a customer to use ELDO as a simulator\\nwithin Cadence, although a hurdle may be the netlisting for the simulator, which may have some\\nspecific aspects different from the netlisting for Spectre or for HSpice.

       " Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, is the specified current\\ndensity limits sufficient for metal width when\\nconsidering ESD ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question. Regarding the required\\nmetal width for ESD, usually the metal resistance is critical and not the current density/current capability\\nof the metal. The current density for HBM ESD pulses is in the range of several hundred mA/um width\\nfor example 300-400mA/um). Only narrow metal lines would be damaged by ESD stress currents. The\\nmetal resistance is critical since voltage drops across power rails will add to the pad clamping voltage.\\nEspecially in the rail-based protection scheme the power rail resistance is critical. Concerning the\\npower rail width, power rails should provide as rule of thumb a DC current capability of 50mA for 2kV\\nHBM ESD robustness. A different metal resistance in the connections of multi-finger ESD protection\\ndevices can result in non-uniform current distribution and early failure of the ESD protection structure.\\nTypical layout errors are e.g. largely different metal width in anode and cathode metal connections of\\ndiodes resulting in a current concentration in a small area of the diode or a largely different metal width\\nbetween drain metal and source metal in ESD nmos snap-back devices resulting as well in non-uniform\\ncurrent distribution.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, what FLATPV and\\nSFLATPV ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

To answer your question. X-FAB does not support\\nIBIS models. This falls beyond the scope of X-FAB's modelling and library support, as we are a\\npure-play wafer manufacturer. As I understand it, the IBIS model provides I/O device characteristics\\nthrough I/V data and switching characteristics in ASCII format. The IBIS models are meant for the\\ntransfer of data and not to define an executable simulation model. They are component specific, which\\nmeans that they model an entire component for example an FPGA and not just a particular I/O. IBIS\\nmodels are supposed to serve for implementing the behavior of I/Os into a technology independent\\nPCB level EMC simulation environment. We cannot provide correct IBIS models since we don't have all\\nthe required package and pin related data.

To answer your question. The Structural and\\nGeometrical Parameters show the metal layer thicknesses as deposited. However if you have large\\noxide windows as are there on the bond pad structures, then the pad metal is thinned (etched back),\\nand this results in thinner metal layers directly on the bonding pads. Some process documents have the\\nbond pad diagrams showing each metal layer with an ARC layer on top and below the metal. These\\nARC layers are relatively thin. The deposited thickness parameters include the ARC layers since they\\naffect the stack thickness and hence all the parasitic capacitances. When the passivation window is\\nopened onto the top metal, the final ARC layer is removed. Hence the bonding pad diagrams and\\nassociated note indicate a lesser thickness.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, what are D_CELLS\\nDECAP cells for ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it.

To answer your question. There are two types of\\ntransistors available in the XI10 process, the H and A types. The A type transistors use the \\'castellated\\'\\nsource/body structure; they have the advantage that they can be made whatever width the customer\\nwants because the body contact is distributed along the source width. However, they have the\\ndisadvantage that the N+ and P+ diffusions for the source and body are touching, so there will be\\nbiasing limitations for these terminals. The xi10 S/D is not silicided, so at least there is no direct short\\nbetween the source and body in these transistors, but with the N+/P+ abutment, trying to apply different\\nvoltages to the source and body will likely result in either high leakage between the two terminals or\\noutright breakdown as this structure is effectively a surface Zener diode. The H type transistors place\\nthe body contacts of the transistors at the ends of the channel and separate the P+ and N+ diffusions\\nby a cross connection of poly to the gate (the designation \\'H\\' transistors comes from the resulting shape\\nof the poly gate). The advantage of these devices is that with the diffusions separated no parasitic\\nZener diode is formed, so leakage and breakdown between the source and body will not be an issue.\\nThe disadvantage of these devices is that due to body resistance perpendicular to the channel, the ratio\\nof W/L is limited for the devices to 6 for the nmos and 12 for the pmos devices.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, how should the poly ring\\nof diodes be biased ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it.

The background here is that we found a bimodal distribution of rpp1 sheet\\nresistance with NWELL below, depending on whether LP5MOS or MOS5 core module was used. To\\naddress this, we now offer two rpp1_3 resistor types: the rpp1_3 and a rpp1nw_3. The rpp1_3 has a\\nnew higher sheet resistance than before while the rpp1nw_3 has the same sheet resistance as the\\nversion 11 rpp1_3. This explains why, using rpp1_3, you get a different length for the same resistance\\nin v12 PDK. You could use the new device rpp1nw_3 instead of rpp1_3 to get a better match to the old\\nv11 and avoid the B7P1 error.

To answer your question. The xt06 FIMP mask\\ndefines where the field implant is not implanted. It is not intuitive that the NOFIMP layer is the direct\\ndesign entry for the FIMP mask.

To answer your question. For a request to hold at\\nPoly, we will hold it at Active (ACT/DIFF) layer instead. For the 0.18um technologies, ACT and POLY1\\ndummies are required and both dummies are interlinked. Therefore, any POLY1 redesign may affect\\nthe ACT layer and may result in a new ACT mask. If the wafers that have been on hold at Poly had\\nalready processed with the old ACT mask, clearly the new ACT mask cannot be used for these wafers.\\nSo to avoid this from happening, we suggest to hold the wafers at the Active layer.
