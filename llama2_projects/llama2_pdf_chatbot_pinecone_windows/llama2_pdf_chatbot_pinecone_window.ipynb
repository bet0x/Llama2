To answer your question regarding of diode forward bias operation in X-Fab, In general we don\\'t\\nsupport forward biasing of diodes in our technologies unless specifically stated such as Schottky\\ndiodes. Mostly this is because the diode model parameters are chosen such that the reverse operation\\nof the diode can be accurately simulated. This does not mean that the simulation of the diodes in\\nforward direction is totally wrong, but it can be less accurate. To model a diode in forward direction\\noften requires parameters that are not available in the model or are insufficiently supported. You can\\nsimulate in forward direction and you will get a typical diode characteristic which is fairly accurate in the\\nlow current range but may be less accurate in the high current range (knee current, series resistance).\\nIn some of our documents is the statement that \"forward bias is not modeled\" which is based on this\\nlack of accuracy in the models. The parameters describing the diode in forward bias are also very\\nlayout-specific, so an accurate model for a diode in forward bias would have to be related to a fixed\\nlayout.\\nCan you tell me, Can you show me on how tospecify an alpha PDK with xkit ?

To answer your question\\nregarding if a new PDK version has been released, do I need to update to PDK package if design is\\nalready in progress, the answers is, for new designs, we recommend customers always use the latest\\nPDK. For designs in progress when an update is released, customers can review the revision notes at\\nwhich both the changes document for the process specifications, and the notes in the rev_info.txt files\\nfor each EDA package to evaluate if the changes are critical to their design. In principle, we could have\\nrare special cases where we wouldn\\'t accept designs based on an older PDK. Bear in mind that at\\ntape-in, our mask tooling team always uses the most recent runset for DRC, so customers might want\\nto check their designs with the latest runset to avoid possible surprises.\\n', metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/Lukas/Desktop/My_Projects/To_Upload/Llama2/llama2_projects/llama2_pdf_chatbot_faiss_windows/data/V3/Hotline_Wiki_v3.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

To answer your question if X-Fab I/O Input output libraries support copper\\nwire bonding is that we do not have any I/O libraries specifically designed for Cu or Copper bonding.\\nSome customers have reported running into problems with copper wire bonding but in at least some\\ncases, different customers have used exactly the same pad structure and one had no problem while the\\nother had issues. This indicates different assembly houses can have quite different bonding\\nparameters, and as copper wire bonding is a harsher process than gold or aluminum bonding,\\nmarginalities in the interaction between the process and bonding are more likely to show up. One\\nsuggestion is to consider using the thick metal (METTHK) module to give the widest bonding margin for\\nassembly and don't use in conjunction with circuit-under-pad techniques. If thick metal is not or cannot\\nbe used, inform your assembly partner of the top metal thickness.\\nCan you tell me, what is the differences between IO_CELLS and HV_CELLS libraries ?

Some general remarks on the differences between HV_CELLS and\\nIO_CELLS are that IO library pad cells are provided as pad-limited or core-limited layouts, support of\\nmultiple power rails. They are also complete IO pad cells with input output buffer circuitry, also HV pad\\ncells are provided as block,layouts, and normally HV ESD protection structures are too big to fit into a\\nLV IO pad cell frame, moreover HV pad cells consist of protection block and bond pad, and usually\\ncontain no power rails or HV input output buffer circuitry and lastly the protection block can be\\ncombined with different size bond pads, and it is intended as a starting point for custom HV ESD pad\\ncell designs.\\n\", metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/Lukas/Desktop/My_Projects/To_Upload/Llama2/llama2_projects/llama2_pdf_chatbot_faiss_windows/data/V3/Hotline_Wiki_v3.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

To answer your question regarding why there is\\nno MIM capacitor antenna DRC checks in XH035 also in other X*035 technology is that for single MIM\\noption on X035, we believe there is no issue with plasma damage. For DMIM construction on X035\\nwhich resembles the case of two individual single MIMs - no cross coupling routing, we also believe\\nthat it has low impact.

To answer your question on how you can solve LVS\\nmismatch due to FILLER cells not extracting into layout netlist is that the problem is due to the fact that\\nthese are empty cells with no devices, but contain ports. Possible strategies to deal with this is one\\ncould simply ignore the mismatched instance errors for these type of cells. Secondly, omitting them\\nfrom the schematic would also produce a match. lastly, an empty cell with ports may be considered as\\na blackbox. Designating all used such cells as blackboxes will work. To do so, go to the Rules section\\nof the PVS LVS form, select the Include PVL tab, check Include PVL Rules, and type the command\\nlvs_black_box followed by the names of all cells to be blackboxed. I suggest to use a space as\\ndelimiter.\\nCan you tell me, how should I resolve the fatal DRC error when my sealring is connected to a ground\\npad ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on how you can resolve the\\nfatal DRC error when sealring is connected to a ground pad is that E1CFCX is usually waived when the\\nintention is to bias the ring by connecting to a voltage source for example by connecting PAD to\\nGround.

To answer your question on how to implement multiple\\ninstances of a ROM each with different programming is that when you are instantiating multiple\\ninstances of the same ROM configuration but with different programmings, it is necessary to use the\\n'extended name' option on the front-end compiler so that each separate instance has a unique name.\\nOtherwise, when IP replacement is performed, both instances will be identical. The distinct names will\\nbe used by the backend compiler so that the top cell name of the generated ROM block will be distinct.\\nOtherwise the cal files submitted will be the same with identical top cell names. Then, even though your\\nblackbox cell names are necessarily different, if we were to proceed with the IP replacement, the result\\nwould be all ROMs with the same programming. Thus to ensure each ROM instance will have the\\ndesired programming, generate the front-end data from the compiler using the extended name option to\\nspecify a unique name for each ROM.\\nCan you tell me and explain the usage of Page 2 of Safety area ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you\\nwith it. To answer your question regarding the usage of Page 2 of Safety area, First, let me clarify a\\ncouple of comments on the datasheet, if power supply interruption during store is impossible then the\\nbackground is that the trim bits for the charge pump are stored in page 2. The trim bits are determined\\nand stored during wafer probe 1. The trim bits control the programming and erase behavior (timing,\\npulses, programming and erase voltage level) of the Store operation. If the trim bits do not have the\\ncorrect value, the endurance and data retention cannot be guaranteed. Any power supply interruption\\n(for example brown-outs) during Store operation could lead to corrupted non-volatile data, because the\\nStore is not executed and finished correctly. Such scenarios are very application dependent. General\\nrecommendation is to store critical data like the trim bits on page 2 during wafer probe and final test and\\ndo no further Store operation to page 2 during the application. If the correct power supply and a correct\\nStore can be guaranteed, storing to page 2 can also be done. Secondly, If no customer safety relevant\\ndata have to be stored it is sufficient to use the maximum size of page 1.

       " Document(page_content=\"Can you tell me, why Q1SU DRC flags or trigger ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer\\nyour question regarding why why Q1SU DRC flags or trigger is that because the SUBCUT layer is not\\nused for any masks, its purpose is only to perform a 'trick' for LVS to pretend the substrate is separable\\nfor different ground domains. The Q1SU rule is only a warning as are all Q* rules. B1SU is the only\\ncheck for how SUBCUT is used; while DRC will always flag Q1SU whenever SUBCUT is present. You\\nmight interpret Q1SU as asking if you are intentionally using SUBCUT.\\nCan you tell me and explain what is Primitive Device List PDL results from Data Input Check ?\\nCertainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the Primitive Device List\\nPDL results from Data Input Check is that PDL primitive device list file is produced from a special LVS\\nrun that only extracts a list of the primitive devices (including parasitic devices) present in your layout.\\nThe parasitic devices would generally be diodes that are part of the structure of high voltage or isolated\\ntransistors. The PDL file is for information only. There have been cases in some of our technologies\\nwhere a primitive device may be superseded by an improved version, or conceivably some issue under\\ncertain operating conditions of a device may have been identified -- in such cases, our Customer\\nProjects department would use the PDL to check if such devices are used in a customer's design and\\nmake sure the customer is aware of the device's status. If you want to know the locations of devices in\\nyour layout, you should perform a parasitic extraction run such as with our Cadence QRC or Calibre\\nPEX runsets.\\nCan you tell me, does X-FAB offer or support Flip Chip support ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you\\nwith it. To answer your question if X-FAB offer or support Flip Chip support is that X-FAB did not\\nsupport any additional processing for flip chip such as the seed and plating layers or the ball deposition\\nso of course customers must discuss that with their assembly subcontractor. X-FAB does not offer any\\nflip-chip specific processing. We don't make any special processing or bondpad designs for flip-chip\\neither, but our standard pads have been used by some customers at flip-chip houses. Please review\\nand understand your assembly partner's rules for flip-chip to check their requirements and see what if\\nany modification might be needed to comply. You should be able to do any layout modifications\\nyourself.\\nCan you tell me, which antenna diode should i use in my design ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you\\nwith it. To answer your question regarding of which antenna diode should you use in your design is that\\nthe connection to DIFF provides a discharge path during manufacture, so its function as an antenna\\ndiode doesn't matter which diode is used. After manufacture, the antenna role is no longer needed, and\\nhow the diode could impact the function of the circuit must dictate which diode is selected. Rather than\\nthe breakdown voltage parameter, the reverse bias operating limit should be used to decide.\\nAlternatively, where possible, a metal bridge close to the at-risk gate oxide can be used to fix an\\nantenna violation.\\nCan you tell me, concerning device operating limits, what do is the meaning of absolute'voltage limits\\nand what it is specify ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question concerning\\ndevice operating limits and what is the meaning of absolute'voltage limits, In general for X-FAB, the\\nabsolute voltage is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a device for a short period of time\\nwithout significant damage. The main reason we phrase it this way is because we can't be sure what\\nthe actual state of the device will be during this period of time. For example, if 7 volts is applied\\nbetween the source and drain of a nmos4 device from the xc06 process 7V is the absolute max value\\nfor these terminals. We are not specifying what voltage is on the gate or body of the device. If the gate\\nand body were at 0V, this voltage could probably be held forever. But if the body was at 0V and the\\ngate was at 2V, there would be significant hot carrier current to the gate and the device could fairly\\nquickly degrade. Since this is a circuit issue, we have to use the conservative definition.

Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To answer your questio\\nregarding on how you can export from Innovus to GDS without having to use Virtuoso to replace\\nabstract views with the layout views is that you can directly write out from Innovus to an OA library that\\nhas replaced abstract views with layout views \"oaOut ${newlibName} ${designName} ${cellName}\\n-autoRemaster -leafViewNames { layout }\". The output library should be different from the Innovus\\nworking OA library, as the new library cannot be read back into Innovus because all timing views and\\nglobal settings will have been lost. Our 180nm technology Cadence PDK kernels include support for\\nGDS export from Innovus. The mapping files to be used when streaming Innovus layers to GDS are in\\nthe technology library corresponding to your PDK setup code, for example\\n\"$X_DIR/xh018/cadence/v*_*/PDK/IC61/v*_*_*/TECH_XH018_1141/pnr_streamout.map\". Additionally,\\nthe PVS QRC runset provides mapping files to be used when running QRC extraction from Innovus, for\\nexample \"$X_DIR/xh018/cadence/v*_*/QRC_pvs/v*_*_*/XH018_1141/QRC-Typ/xx018_lef_qrc.map\".\\nThis file exists also in the QRC-Min and QRC-Max folders.\\nCan you tell me, Assura tool gives background stamp errors and What exactly are these meaning ?\\nCertainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the Assura tool gives you\\nbackground stamp errors and meaning behind this errors is that The bkgnd_StampErrorFloat error\\nsimply means that the layout being checked has no connection to the substrate. Placing even just a\\nsingle PDIFF contact will clear the error of course such would not be sufficient for an entire chip. The\\nbkgnd_StampErrorMult and bkgnd_StampErrorConnect errors work together to indicate that the layout\\nhas multiple substrate connections that are not connected to the same node with metal which resulting\\nin soft connections through the substrate. Assura will flag one of the connections stamps with\\nbkgnd_StampErrorMult and all of the others with bkgnd_StampErrorConnect.\\nCan you tell me, what is the meaning of the Assura \\'minority PTUB connectors\\' error message ?\\nCertainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the meaning of the\\nAssura \\'minority PTUB connectors\\' error message is that It is generated by the connect statement from\\nAssura. It means that more than one net is connected to the layer. The stamped layer receives the net\\ninformation from the net with the most contacts. All other nets are marked with this error. For more\\ndetailed information please refer to the Assura manuals. X-FAB does not document tool specific\\nmessages. The Assura Command Reference manual (a document primarily aimed at runset\\ndevelopers) explains that: \\'A layer with a soft connection is a layer that only receives connectivity\\ninformation and does not pass on that connectivity information. You can use the soft keyword to check\\nlayers for high-resistivity, such as wells, where you want them to be part of the net, but you do not want\\nthem to be used as a connection between two conducting layers. This means PTUB_soft_connect\\nerrors are \\'soft connection\\' shorts through a common layer, which is often the PSUB, or a common well.\\nIn other words, multiple distinct nets are connected to that common layer. Perhaps those distinct nets\\nwere not intended to be distinct and should be connected together by metal. It also should be inferred\\nthat it is not an error that you\\'ll find defined in an X-FAB Design Rule Specification.

To answer your question on where you\\ncan find QRC tech file for X*035, 0.35um or 350nm process that can be used with Innovus tools is that\\nX-FAB does not support the QRC extraction from Innovus by using Quantus and QRC-tech files for our\\n0.35um or X*035 processes.

To answer your question regarding recommendations for corner lot splits is that the short\\nanswer is that unlike most digital-dominated fabs, we don't have a set menu of split conditions based on\\nfast / typ / slow that customers should choose because in a mixed signal design there is often a lot\\nmore than just Vt and poly CD that can be critical to the design (but those parameters would normally\\n\", metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/Lukas/Desktop/My_Projects/To_Upload/Llama2/llama2_projects/llama2_pdf_chatbot_faiss_windows/data/V3/Hotline_Wiki_v3.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"be sufficient for a digital design). Therefore it's normal for a customer to make a specific request on\\nwhat parameters it is desired to adjust and the relevant fab will review and confirm if that set of corners\\nis possible. The negotiation would be done through Customer Projects at the relevant fab. Our digital\\nlibraries and memories are characterized in the process fast/slow 3 Sigma range. 3 Sigma production\\nmeans that 99.73% of the delivered wafers are OK in terms of the stable process parameters. The\\nprocess parameters are monitored with PCM test structures on each wafer. So, if your digital design is\\nDRC, LVS clean and the timing analysis with post layout extraction is OK at the conditions as follow: 1).\\nPVT = wp(fast), VDD_max, Tj_min 2). PVT = ws(slow), VDD_min, Tj_max then you can expect 99.73%\\nyield of the digital block in terms of process parameter deviations. The majority of our customers don't\\nask for corner lots for their projects, but some customers do it. The Vt and gate length adjustments\\nimplied by your proposed corners impact the relevant transistor parameters for digital timing which are\\nsaturation current and threshold voltage. The usual flow for ordering corner lots begins with the\\ncustomer identifying the critical process parameters for their design (might not be simply 'digital'\\nparameters) and submitting a list of required corners (must conform to the PCM pass/fail parameters)\\nto X-FAB. The feasibility of such process variations will be checked by X-FAB (Customer Projects\\nteam) and then a final corner split proposal is sent. The goal of such a corner should be to evaluate that\\nthe design would work at lower and upper spec limits. So the typical values are the upper and lower\\nlimits of the PCM Acceptance Specification (PAS). Here are some comments that have been collected\\nfrom one of our FSEs. If you design according to the design rules, then the simulations should be\\nsufficient. Some products require that the design rules be pushed to meet the performance\\nrequirements. In these cases, corner lots can identify process sensitivities where yield can be\\ncompromised. I would estimate that less than 10% of my customers are relying on Corner Lots for\\ncharacterization, and these are generally only for high-volume products. When they do request they\\ntypically look at simple VTN/VTP, maybe HiRes Poly. The parameters are really design dependent.\\nEven when I do get customers running corner lots, I'm not getting much feedback and request for\\nproduct specific parametric targeting. This leads to my perception about the accuracy of the\\nsimulations. Potentially more effective than corner lots is coordinating a yield feedback loop once\\nproducts are released to production. If we get your yield, bin, etc. information and input it into our yield\\nenhancement software, we can correlate to equipment, inline, PCM, visual inspection, etc. Customers\\nthat work with us on this feedback will achieve yield stabilization much more quickly than without. We\\ncan work with you to review your Wafer/Final Test and coordinate the best means for yield feedback.\\nOne of our application engineers expanded on those comments, The customers that do request corner\\nlots usually settle on +/-3 sigma for the parameters they are interested in. The LV MOS VT parameters\\nare usually selected. Beyond that it really depends on the specifics of the process options the customer\\nhas chosen and the sensitivities their designers are most concerned with. However, there are some\\nsignificant limitations on what parameters can be varied cleanly in a corner split. The LV MOS VT\\nparameters are relatively straight forward because there is usually a separate VT adjust implant used\\non them that is separate from the well implant that controls breakdown and punch through, however\\nthere are usually a few interactions that cant be avoided (like output resistance and nw sheet\\nresistance). The high sheet resistance poly resistors are generally easy to vary because there is usually\\na dedicated implant for that parameter. Beyond that things get more difficult. The HV transistor VT is\\nsometimes split but there is almost always an interaction with transistor BVDSS, punch through,\\nsometimes field threshold and often other parameters which can complicate evaluating the split. Other\\nparameters are very difficult or expensive to split such as gate oxide thickness or capacitor values\\nbecause they require dedicated diffusion or deposition runs that use the capacity of five or 6 lots for\\neach split. My background is process development and I used to be a big fan of corner splits and ran a\\nlot of them myself. I eventually concluded that they were not that useful for three reasons as follow: 1).\\nToo often there are parameter interactions that you cannot avoid which makes it difficult to impossible\\nto get clean results from the splits. 2). You may plan for nominal, +3 sigma and -3 sigma splits but due\\nto normal process variation you usually end up with each of these splits +/- 1 sigma or so from your\\nintended target, e.g. -1 sigma, +2 sigma and -4 sigma, which again makes analysis difficult or\\nimpossible and may result in some splits being non-functional. * The corner splits are arranged by\\nartificially varying one process parameter, such as the VT implant.

Each of\\nthese parameters has a different magnitude and direction impact on several different device\\nparameters, usually for several different devices.

To answer your question on how you can display\\nDC operating parameters that you expect but not shown on the schematic is that some DC operating\\nparameters that are available in the Results Browser may not be displayable in the schematic. You\\nmight try adding all the required parameters to the ADE L Outputs window. This would help you to view\\nyour results after your run instead of looking into the Results Browser every time.

Certainly, I\\'d be happy to\\nhelp you with it. To answer your question if it is okay if you design exceed a transistor or device\\noperating limit is that The breakdown voltage of a transistor is a kind of \\'digital\\' description of the\\ntransistor strength. But the real life is manifold. Therefore reliability tests are performed to describe the\\ntransistor strength for the real world conditions. If the operating conditions are far away from the\\nelectrical limits there is no danger. But if the operating conditions get closer to the electrical limits the\\nprobability of malfunction or damage increases. Each MOS transistor consists of a parasitic bipolar\\ntransistor. This parasitic bipolar transistor makes the MOS transistor sensitive to pulses. The sensitivity\\ndepends on many factors. On the one hand on the pulse characteristics such as amplitude, length, duty\\ncycle, rise and fall time, ripple, frequency and etc. On the other hand factors include the transistor\\nlayout such as size, construction, spacing to substrate contacts and others. There is an unlimited\\namount of possible scenarios. This is what it makes very difficult to judge whether special conditions\\ncan be allowed or not. Therefore only one general recommendation is to never exceed the specified\\noperating limits.\\nCan you tell me, what is the difference between protection diodes and other diodes? Certainly, I\\'d be\\nhappy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the differences between protection diodes\\nand other diodes is that protection diode needs to carry a relatively high amount of current in\\nbreakdown to really protect the circuit, otherwise the voltage drop at the device to be protected can still\\nbe too high and do damage to it. Therefore it is measured at higher currents. Protection diodes are\\n\\'designed\\' to have a certain breakdown voltage which is defined rather by layout (overlap of wells,\\ndistances) not by doping profile. Note that usually it is more a concern about the contacts and wiring\\nwhen looking at the current limits, rather than the diode parameters.\\nCan you tell me, if I ignore DRC errors on my logo elements ? Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it.\\nTo answer your question if you can ignore DRC errors on your logo elements is that although a logo\\nstrucure is not a circuit element, it can be very dangerous, in some cases, to waive logo DRC errors.\\nFor example, metals and/or photo-resist that are below minimum width may float off the silicon during\\nthe processing and then get deposited elsewhere on the design and cause chip failures.\\nCan you tell me, which DRC rules are classified as fatal ? Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To\\nanswer your question regarding which DRC rules are classified as fatal is that we do not publish a list of\\nFatal vs Critical errors as they are constantly under review and publication would imply that there are\\nsome errors that we don\\'t mind the customer violating - that is not the case. We encourage customers\\nto correct all errors - this will produce the best possible outcome on silicon.

Certainly, I'd be\\nhappy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the purpose of the technology libraries\\nwith an 'HD' suffix is that Using xh018 as example, TECH_XH018 is the primary technology library to\\nuse. TECH_XH018_HD is a supplementary library, to be used in addition to TECH_X018, when the HD\\nhigh density logic libraries D_CELLS_*HD are used. It accounts for the tighter routing grid used by the\\nHD logic libraries for P&R; or place and routes. Originally, the HD tech library was developed as a\\nsupplementary library, meaning both the normal and HD libraries should be used referenced by a\\ndesign library using an HD logic library for P&R.; We then decided to make the HD tech library more\\ncomplete such that on the HD tech lib needed to be referenced by the design library. In such case, if\\nyou try to reference both tech libs, you will get a conflict error. More recently, we have reverted back to\\nthe original style.\\nCan you tell me, if ELDO views for Cadence PDK is available ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with\\nit. To answer your question if ELDO views for Cadence PDK is available is that Unfortunately we don't\\nsupport ELDO views in our Cadence PDKs. An extra license is necessary to test such views in\\nCadence libraries, and we do not have that currently in X-FAB, so we cannot check and guarantee the\\ncorrectness of such views. In principle it might be possible for a customer to use ELDO as a simulator\\nwithin Cadence, although a hurdle may be the netlisting for the simulator, which may have some\\nspecific aspects different from the netlisting for Spectre or for HSpice. The conclusion is that X-FAB\\ndoes not support ELDO simulation from Virtuoso within Cadence and that we don't have any\\ninstructions for those attempting to do so.\\nCan you tell me, the recommendation or suggestion of electromigration tests for AC or DC factor ?\\nCertainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the recommendation or\\nsuggestion of electromigration tests for AC or DC factor is that we usually calculate with a DC to AC\\nconversion factor of 10.

       " Document(page_content=\"usually the metal resistance is critical and not the current density/current capability of the metal. The\\ncurrent density for HBM ESD pulses is in the range of several hundred mA/um width for example\\n300-400mA/um). Only narrow metal lines would be damaged by ESD stress currents. The metal\\nresistance is critical since voltage drops across power rails will add to the pad clamping voltage.\\nEspecially in the rail-based protection scheme the power rail resistance is critical. Concerning the\\npower rail width, power rails should provide as rule of thumb a DC current capability of 50mA for 2kV\\nHBM ESD robustness.

Certainly, I'd be happy to\\nhelp you with it. To answer your question regarding the procedure for an IO and ESD review by X-FAB\\nis that the customer sends the layouts, schematics and all relevant descriptions such as normal pin\\noperating voltages, max. ratings, required ESD robustness and etc to hotline@xfab.com. It is important\\nfor the review that when any type of analog IO cell (LV or HV) is used, also the circuitry that connects\\ndirectly to the pad must be shown. We'll review the design data and provide first results via email.\\nThere can then be further review loops after design changes. There can then be also further online or\\nface-to-face meetings for clarification - if required. A design review in an online meeting or face-to-face\\nmeeting is not appropriate. There is a higher risk that possible ESD design issues are overlooked when\\nthere is just a browsing through the design during an online meeting. Therefore an offline review is\\npreferred.\\nCan you tell me, How can I use various GATES logic libraries? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with\\nit. To answer your question on how you can use various GATES logic libraries is that the GATES\\nlibraries are schematic and parameters only libraries which are used as referenced 'building block'\\ngates libraries inside the D_CELLS libraries. They support only the schematic side of the respective\\nD_CELLS* libraries the rev_info.txt file of a given D_CELLS library will specify which GATES* library it\\nrequires. Therefore the GATES libraries cannot and must not be used as a stand-alone library.\\nCan you tell me, where I can find GATES_PCELL library that is available for most technologies?\\nCertainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on where you can find\\nGATES_PCELL library that is available for most technologies is that the library is classified as an\\nanalog library for the purpose of my X-FAB organization under Design > EDA Files, filter to Libraries >\\nAnalog > GATES_PCELL. However, unlike our other analog libraries, these GATES_PCELL libraries\\nare freely available to customers, there is no license requirement or fee. Within the library is a\\nuserguide document.

Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question why simulations\\nof transistor leakage produce inaccurate results that are independent of device widths is that this issue\\nis related to the default gmin setting of the simulator, which is gmin=1e-12. This gives every node a\\nconductivity of 1e-12 to aid convergence. That means basically it 'adds' at 1V a current of 1e-12A.\\nTherefore this is not dependent on the transistor's width. To get correct results for such diode currents\\nof small devices at T=27C you need to set gmin=1e-18. Please note that for some simulators like\\nhspice, there are separate parameters: gmin and gmindc.\\nCan you tell me, if X-FAB can provide IBIS models ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To\\nanswer your question if X-FAB can provide IBIS models is that X-Fab does not support IBIS models.\\nThis falls beyond the scope of X-FAB's modelling and library support, as we are a pure-play wafer\\nmanufacturer. As I understand it, the IBIS model provides I/O device characteristics through I/V data\\nand switching characteristics in ASCII format. The IBIS models are meant for the transfer of data and\\nnot to define an executable simulation model. They are component specific, which means that they\\nmodel an entire component for example an FPGA and not just a particular I/O. IBIS models are\\nsupposed to serve for implementing the behavior of I/Os into a technology independent PCB level EMC\\nsimulation environment. We cannot provide correct IBIS models since we don't have all the required\\npackage and pin related data. I/O cell characteristics are available in data sheets, Verilog models and\\nespecially the timing Liberty format files, which you could use to generate the switching characteristic\\nfor an IBIS model.\\nCan you tell me, What is the maximum recommended temperature for wafer post processing ?\\nCertainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the maximum\\nrecommended temperature for wafer post processing for post-processing is that usually we generally\\nrecommend that temperatures above 350C should be absolutely prevented. Higher temperatures can\\nlead to metal-passivation or capacitor popping, IMD cracking, transistor shifts, metal voiding, enhanced\\nRpoly and especially RpolyH shifts depending on design, temperature ramp rate, duration and\\napplication atmosphere (N2, H2, etc.). If >350C cannot be avoided, we strongly recommend a DOE\\nwith the respective IC design using enhanced final test and also proper optical inspections after slightly\\naccelerated post-processing stress for example slightly increased ramp rates, slightly longer storage\\ntimes.\\nCan you tell me, Why my account cannot download a memory compiler ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help\\nyou with it. To answer your question why your account cannot download a memory compiler is that\\nX-FAB does not distribute our memory compiler software to customers.

Certainly, I\\'d be\\nhappy to help you with it. To answer your question why metal layers is thinner on the bond pad is that\\nthe Structural and Geometrical Parameters show the metal layer thicknesses as deposited. However if\\nyou have large oxide windows as are there on the bond pad structures, then the pad metal is thinned\\n(etched back), and this results in thinner metal layers directly on the bonding pads. Some process\\ndocuments have the bond pad diagrams showing each metal layer with an ARC layer on top and below\\nthe metal. These ARC layers are relatively thin. The deposited thickness parameters include the ARC\\nlayers since they affect the stack thickness and hence all the parasitic capacitances. When the\\npassivation window is opened onto the top metal, the final ARC layer is removed. Hence the bonding\\npad diagrams and associated note indicate a lesser thickness.\\nCan you tell me, what are D_CELLS DECAP cells for ? Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To\\nanswer your question of what is D_CELLS DECAP cells for is that these cells provide capacitors\\nbetween vdd and gnd to reduce digital noise and IR drop. They are usually inserted during Place and\\nRoute after routing (where existing routing allows). In a second step, FEED* cells always have to be\\ninserted to fill up the cell rows in places where no DECAP cells could be added. You may add (the\\nlarger, DECAP*15/DECAP*25) cells also before routing to have a certain amounnt of capacitors in the\\nblock, but these cells might have an influence on routability of the block.

Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding PDL.txt file or\\nprimitive device list that is included from the X-Fab DRC run result is that the PDL is a primitive device\\nlist. This file is the result of a special LVS run that only extracts the primitive devices (including parasitic\\ndevices) present in your layout. The parasitic devices included (p_*) would generally be diodes that are\\npart of the structure of high voltage or isolated transistors. The PDL file is for information only. There\\nhave been cases in some of our technologies where a primitive device may be superseded by an\\nimproved version, or conceivably some issue under certain operating conditions of a device may have\\nbeen identified -- in such cases, our Customer Projects department would use the PDL to check if such\\ndevices are used in a customer\\'s design and make sure the customer is aware of the device\\'s status.\\nCan you tell me, The PVS.sum DRC result will last error counts for each rule like RULECHECK\\nB1M2MIM .............

Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding\\nwhy X-Fab pattern fill did not resolve, fix or clear R1DF minimum DIFF density design rule violations or\\nerrors because As flatly stated in the \\'Dummy Pattern Generation\\' section of the Design Rule\\nSpecification, \\'The dummy pattern generation script does not guarantee that the minimum and\\nmaximum structure densities of the related layer are met.\\' The document further recommends \\'to use\\nX-FAB\\'s dummy pattern generation option (DUMMY_FILL included in the DRC for preview) to create\\ndummy pattern.

Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help\\nyou with it. To answer your question regarding the basis for Schottky diode forward bias limit is that It is\\nimportant not to exceed the Vanode-Vcathode operating limit for the forward direction current.

To\\nanswer your question regarding of what films are on the wafer backside, as an example from a\\nparticular technology flow, backside films include a stack of oxide, nitride, TEOS, SION, nitride (the\\nmost outer layer). There may be some differences depending on technology and module options.\\nDuring manufacture, the backside is not necessarily protected from what is grown or deposited on the\\nfront side (this would be the case, for example, when wafers are loaded for batch processing into a tool\\nin a quartz boat), so there is some accumulation of films on the backside.

To answer your question regarding the SPICE\\nmodel libraries that include *_bjt models for some MOS devices and what it is for, In short the purpose\\nof the added PNP bipolars to the *_bjt models is to show that there can occur bipolar effects under\\ncertain conditions, but it is by far not very accurate and it has limitations. It is nevertheless extracted on\\nsilicon at different geometries and good simulation accuracy can be expected when the HVMOS\\nchannel is completely switched off and only the drain/bulk junction is forward-biased. But in other\\ncases, the accuracy is limited, especially when the channel is in inversion and/or the bulk/substrate\\njunction is forward-biased. Both conditions change the minority carrier distribution in the bulk/base a lot\\nand lead to a change in the beta. There is no statistical process monitoring for these parasitic BJTs. In\\nour experience the most reliable results and complete picture in simulation can be achieved with the\\nsubstrate extractor tool, which is supported for xh018.

To answer your question regarding the the differences,\\ndistinction between the types of body tied transistors is that there are two types of transistors available\\nin the XI10 process, the H and A types. The A type transistors use the \\'castellated\\' source/body\\nstructure; they have the advantage that they can be made whatever width the customer wants because\\nthe body contact is distributed along the source width. However, they have the disadvantage that the\\nN+ and P+ diffusions for the source and body are touching, so there will be biasing limitations for these\\nterminals. The xi10 S/D is not silicided, so at least there is no direct short between the source and body\\nin these transistors, but with the N+/P+ abutment, trying to apply different voltages to the source and\\nbody will likely result in either high leakage between the two terminals or outright breakdown as this\\nstructure is effectively a surface Zener diode. The H type transistors place the body contacts of the\\ntransistors at the ends of the channel and separate the P+ and N+ diffusions by a cross connection of\\npoly to the gate (the designation \\'H\\' transistors comes from the resulting shape of the poly gate). The\\nadvantage of these devices is that with the diffusions separated no parasitic Zener diode is formed, so\\nleakage and breakdown between the source and body will not be an issue. The disadvantage of these\\ndevices is that due to body resistance perpendicular to the channel, the ratio of W/L is limited for the\\ndevices to 6 for the nmos and 12 for the pmos devices.\\nCan you tell me, how should the poly ring of diodes be biased ? Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with\\nit. To answer your question on how should the poly ring of diodes be biased is that due to its lateral\\nconstruction, the diode is different from pure bulk junction diodes in other processes.

Certainly, I'd be happy to\\nhelp you with it. To answer your question regarding after upgrading to version 12 PDK, why do rpp1\\ninstances of existing design show different parameter values that flag and trigger B7P1 design rule\\nviolations is that this is due to the underlying well options. The background here is that we found a\\nbimodal distribution of rpp1 sheet resistance with NWELL below, depending on whether LP5MOS or\\nMOS5 core module was used. To address this, we now offer two rpp1_3 resistor types: the rpp1_3 and\\na rpp1nw_3. The rpp1_3 has a new higher sheet resistance than before while the rpp1nw_3 has the\\nsame sheet resistance as the version 11 rpp1_3. This explains why, using rpp1_3, you get a different\\nlength for the same resistance in v12 PDK. You could use the new device rpp1nw_3 instead of rpp1_3\\nto get a better match to the old v11 and avoid the B7P1 error. Alternatively, you could leave your layout\\nas-is and waive the B7P1 error as it is not fatal, but then if the design is re-used in a different core\\nmodule later, you may see a different performance.\\nCan you tell me, What is the relation, coorelation of FIMP mask to drawn layers ? Certainly, I'd be\\nhappy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the the relation, coorelation of FIMP mask\\nto drawn layers is that xt06 FIMP mask defines where the field implant is not implanted.

Certainly, I'd\\nbe happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding at what step are the wafers actually\\nheld or stop especially for wafer held at poly is that for a request to hold at Poly, we will hold it at Active\\n(ACT/DIFF) layer instead. For the 0.18um technologies, ACT and POLY1 dummies are required and\\nboth dummies are interlinked. Therefore, any POLY1 redesign may affect the ACT layer and may result\\nin a new ACT mask. If the wafers that have been on hold at Poly had already processed with the old\\nACT mask, clearly the new ACT mask cannot be used for these wafers. So to avoid this from\\nhappening, we suggest to hold the wafers at the Active layer. However, if you can confirm that your\\nfuture redesign will not change the ACT mask, we can support your request to hold the wafers at Poly.\\nCan you tell me, What helps are available for resolving, clearing, fix MIM capacitor antenna errors ?\\nCertainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.
