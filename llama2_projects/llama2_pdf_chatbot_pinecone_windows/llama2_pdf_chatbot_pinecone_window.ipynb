To answer your question regarding of diode forward\\nbias operation in X-Fab, In general we don\\'t support forward biasing of diodes in our technologies\\nunless specifically stated such as Schottky diodes. Mostly this is because the diode model parameters\\nare chosen such that the reverse operation of the diode can be accurately simulated. This does not\\nmean that the simulation of the diodes in forward direction is totally wrong, but it can be less accurate.\\nTo model a diode in forward direction often requires parameters that are not available in the model or\\nare insufficiently supported. You can simulate in forward direction and you will get a typical diode\\ncharacteristic which is fairly accurate in the low current range but may be less accurate in the high\\ncurrent range (knee current, series resistance). In some of our documents is the statement that\\n\"forward bias is not modeled\" which is based on this lack of accuracy in the models. The parameters\\ndescribing the diode in forward bias are also very layout-specific, so an accurate model for a diode in\\nforward bias would have to be related to a fixed layout.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, Can you show me on how\\ntospecify an alpha PDK with xkit ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it.

To answer your question regarding if a new PDK\\nversion has been released, do I need to update to PDK package if design is already in progress, the\\nanswers is, for new designs, we recommend customers always use the latest PDK. For designs in\\nprogress when an update is released, customers can review the revision notes at which both the\\nchanges document for the process specifications, and the notes in the rev_info.txt files for each EDA\\npackage to evaluate if the changes are critical to their design. In principle, we could have rare special\\ncases where we wouldn't accept designs based on an older PDK. Bear in mind that at tape-in, our\\nmask tooling team always uses the most recent runset for DRC, so customers might want to check their\\ndesigns with the latest runset to avoid possible surprises.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, Is there any correlation\\nbetween the deviation of the sheet resistance (RS) of\\nresistors and that of their thermal coefficients TC1\\nand TC2 ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

To answer your question if X-Fab I/O Input output\\nlibraries support copper wire bonding is that we do not have any I/O libraries specifically designed for\\nCu or Copper bonding. Some customers have reported running into problems with copper wire bonding\\nbut in at least some cases, different customers have used exactly the same pad structure and one had\\nno problem while the other had issues. This indicates different assembly houses can have quite\\ndifferent bonding parameters, and as copper wire bonding is a harsher process than gold or aluminum\\nbonding, marginalities in the interaction between the process and bonding are more likely to show up.\\nOne suggestion is to consider using the thick metal (METTHK) module to give the widest bonding\\nmargin for assembly and don't use in conjunction with circuit-under-pad techniques. If thick metal is not\\nor cannot be used, inform your assembly partner of the top metal thickness.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, what is the differences\\nbetween IO_CELLS and HV_CELLS libraries ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the differences\\nbetween IO_CELLS and HV_CELLS libraries are For 5V application or LV application, it is normally\\nsufficient to use IO_CELLS*. HV_CELLS are mainly used when none of the IO_CELLS* fit your\\nrequirement, such as needing to implement HV ESD protection. Some general remarks on the\\ndifferences between HV_CELLS and IO_CELLS are that IO library pad cells are provided as\\npad-limited or core-limited layouts, support of multiple power rails. They are also complete IO pad cells\\nwith input output buffer circuitry, also HV pad cells are provided as block,layouts, and normally HV ESD\\nprotection structures are too big to fit into a LV IO pad cell frame, moreover HV pad cells consist of\\nprotection block and bond pad, and usually contain no power rails or HV input output buffer circuitry\\nand lastly the protection block can be combined with different size bond pads, and it is intended as a\\nstarting point for custom HV ESD pad cell designs.\\n\", metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/Lukas/Desktop/My_Projects/To_Upload/Llama2/llama2_projects/llama2_pdf_chatbot_faiss_windows/data/V2/Hotline_Wiki_v2.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on how you can solve LVS\\nmismatch due to FILLER cells not extracting into layout netlist is that the problem is due to the fact that\\nthese are empty cells with no devices, but contain ports. Possible strategies to deal with this is one\\ncould simply ignore the mismatched instance errors for these type of cells. Secondly, omitting them\\nfrom the schematic would also produce a match. lastly, an empty cell with ports may be considered as\\na blackbox. Designating all used such cells as blackboxes will work. To do so, go to the Rules section\\nof the PVS LVS form, select the Include PVL tab, check Include PVL Rules, and type the command\\nlvs_black_box followed by the names of all cells to be blackboxed.

To answer your question on how to implement\\nmultiple instances of a ROM each with different programming is that when you are instantiating multiple\\ninstances of the same ROM configuration but with different programmings, it is necessary to use the\\n'extended name' option on the front-end compiler so that each separate instance has a unique name.\\nOtherwise, when IP replacement is performed, both instances will be identical. The distinct names will\\nbe used by the backend compiler so that the top cell name of the generated ROM block will be distinct.\\nOtherwise the cal files submitted will be the same with identical top cell names. Then, even though your\\nblackbox cell names are necessarily different, if we were to proceed with the IP replacement, the result\\nwould be all ROMs with the same programming. Thus to ensure each ROM instance will have the\\ndesired programming, generate the front-end data from the compiler using the extended name option to\\nspecify a unique name for each ROM.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me and explain the usage of\\nPage 2 of Safety area ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the usage of\\nPage 2 of Safety area, First, let me clarify a couple of comments on the datasheet, if power supply\\ninterruption during store is impossible then the background is that the trim bits for the charge pump are\\nstored in page 2. The trim bits are determined and stored during wafer probe 1. The trim bits control the\\nprogramming and erase behavior (timing, pulses, programming and erase voltage level) of the Store\\noperation. If the trim bits do not have the correct value, the endurance and data retention cannot be\\nguaranteed. Any power supply interruption (for example brown-outs) during Store operation could lead\\nto corrupted non-volatile data, because the Store is not executed and finished correctly. Such scenarios\\nare very application dependent. General recommendation is to store critical data like the trim bits on\\n\", metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/Lukas/Desktop/My_Projects/To_Upload/Llama2/llama2_projects/llama2_pdf_chatbot_faiss_windows/data/V2/Hotline_Wiki_v2.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

To answer your question regarding why why Q1SU\\nDRC flags or trigger is that because the SUBCUT layer is not used for any masks, its purpose is only to\\nperform a 'trick' for LVS to pretend the substrate is separable for different ground domains. The Q1SU\\nrule is only a warning as are all Q* rules. B1SU is the only check for how SUBCUT is used; while DRC\\nwill always flag Q1SU whenever SUBCUT is present. You might interpret Q1SU as asking if you are\\nintentionally using SUBCUT.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me and explain what is\\nPrimitive Device List PDL results from Data Input\\nCheck ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the Primitive\\nDevice List PDL results from Data Input Check is that PDL primitive device list file is produced from a\\nspecial LVS run that only extracts a list of the primitive devices (including parasitic devices) present in\\nyour layout. The parasitic devices would generally be diodes that are part of the structure of high\\nvoltage or isolated transistors. The PDL file is for information only. There have been cases in some of\\nour technologies where a primitive device may be superseded by an improved version, or conceivably\\nsome issue under certain operating conditions of a device may have been identified -- in such cases,\\nour Customer Projects department would use the PDL to check if such devices are used in a\\ncustomer's design and make sure the customer is aware of the device's status.

To answer your question regarding of which antenna\\ndiode should you use in your design is that the connection to DIFF provides a discharge path during\\nmanufacture, so its function as an antenna diode doesn't matter which diode is used. After\\nmanufacture, the antenna role is no longer needed, and how the diode could impact the function of the\\ncircuit must dictate which diode is selected. Rather than the breakdown voltage parameter, the reverse\\nbias operating limit should be used to decide. Alternatively, where possible, a metal bridge close to the\\nat-risk gate oxide can be used to fix an antenna violation.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, concerning device\\noperating limits, what do is the meaning of\\nabsolute'voltage limits and what it is specify ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question concerning device\\noperating limits and what is the meaning of absolute'voltage limits, In general for X-FAB, the absolute\\nvoltage is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a device for a short period of time without\\nsignificant damage. The main reason we phrase it this way is because we can't be sure what the actual\\nstate of the device will be during this period of time. For example, if 7 volts is applied between the\\nsource and drain of a nmos4 device from the xc06 process 7V is the absolute max value for these\\nterminals. We are not specifying what voltage is on the gate or body of the device. If the gate and body\\nwere at 0V, this voltage could probably be held forever. But if the body was at 0V and the gate was at\\n2V, there would be significant hot carrier current to the gate and the device could fairly quickly degrade.\\nSince this is a circuit issue, we have to use the conservative definition. If in your designs you can\\nguarantee that the devices are always off when the maximum voltage is applied, the devices will\\nprobably survive indefinitely. However, please remember that X-FAB will not guarantee this.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me,how I can export from\\nInnovus to GDS without having to use Virtuoso to\\nreplace abstract views with the layout views ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

To answer your question regarding the meaning of\\nthe Assura \\'minority PTUB connectors\\' error message is that It is generated by the connect statement\\nfrom Assura. It means that more than one net is connected to the layer. The stamped layer receives the\\nnet information from the net with the most contacts. All other nets are marked with this error.

You can use the soft keyword to check\\nlayers for high-resistivity, such as wells, where you want them to be part of the net, but you do not want\\nthem to be used as a connection between two conducting layers.

       " Document(page_content=\"we don't have a set menu of split conditions based on fast / typ / slow that customers should choose\\nbecause in a mixed signal design there is often a lot more than just Vt and poly CD that can be critical\\nto the design (but those parameters would normally be sufficient for a digital design). Therefore it's\\nnormal for a customer to make a specific request on what parameters it is desired to adjust and the\\nrelevant fab will review and confirm if that set of corners is possible. The negotiation would be done\\nthrough Customer Projects at the relevant fab. Our digital libraries and memories are characterized in\\nthe process fast/slow 3 Sigma range. 3 Sigma production means that 99.73% of the delivered wafers\\nare OK in terms of the stable process parameters. The process parameters are monitored with PCM\\ntest structures on each wafer. So, if your digital design is DRC, LVS clean and the timing analysis with\\npost layout extraction is OK at the conditions as follow: 1). PVT = wp(fast), VDD_max, Tj_min 2). PVT =\\nws(slow), VDD_min, Tj_max then you can expect 99.73% yield of the digital block in terms of process\\nparameter deviations. The majority of our customers don't ask for corner lots for their projects, but\\nsome customers do it. The Vt and gate length adjustments implied by your proposed corners impact the\\nrelevant transistor parameters for digital timing which are saturation current and threshold voltage. The\\nusual flow for ordering corner lots begins with the customer identifying the critical process parameters\\nfor their design (might not be simply 'digital' parameters) and submitting a list of required corners (must\\nconform to the PCM pass/fail parameters) to X-FAB. The feasibility of such process variations will be\\nchecked by X-FAB (Customer Projects team) and then a final corner split proposal is sent. The goal of\\nsuch a corner should be to evaluate that the design would work at lower and upper spec limits. So the\\ntypical values are the upper and lower limits of the PCM Acceptance Specification (PAS). Here are\\nsome comments that have been collected from one of our FSEs. If you design according to the design\\nrules, then the simulations should be sufficient. Some products require that the design rules be pushed\\nto meet the performance requirements. In these cases, corner lots can identify process sensitivities\\nwhere yield can be compromised. I would estimate that less than 10% of my customers are relying on\\nCorner Lots for characterization, and these are generally only for high-volume products. When they do\\nrequest they typically look at simple VTN/VTP, maybe HiRes Poly. The parameters are really design\\ndependent. Even when I do get customers running corner lots, I'm not getting much feedback and\\nrequest for product specific parametric targeting. This leads to my perception about the accuracy of the\\nsimulations. Potentially more effective than corner lots is coordinating a yield feedback loop once\\nproducts are released to production. If we get your yield, bin, etc. information and input it into our yield\\nenhancement software, we can correlate to equipment, inline, PCM, visual inspection, etc. Customers\\nthat work with us on this feedback will achieve yield stabilization much more quickly than without. We\\ncan work with you to review your Wafer/Final Test and coordinate the best means for yield feedback.\\nOne of our application engineers expanded on those comments, The customers that do request corner\\nlots usually settle on +/-3 sigma for the parameters they are interested in. The LV MOS VT parameters\\nare usually selected. Beyond that it really depends on the specifics of the process options the customer\\nhas chosen and the sensitivities their designers are most concerned with. However, there are some\\nsignificant limitations on what parameters can be varied cleanly in a corner split. The LV MOS VT\\nparameters are relatively straight forward because there is usually a separate VT adjust implant used\\non them that is separate from the well implant that controls breakdown and punch through, however\\nthere are usually a few interactions that cant be avoided (like output resistance and nw sheet\\nresistance). The high sheet resistance poly resistors are generally easy to vary because there is usually\\na dedicated implant for that parameter. Beyond that things get more difficult. The HV transistor VT is\\nsometimes split but there is almost always an interaction with transistor BVDSS, punch through,\\nsometimes field threshold and often other parameters which can complicate evaluating the split. Other\\nparameters are very difficult or expensive to split such as gate oxide thickness or capacitor values\\nbecause they require dedicated diffusion or deposition runs that use the capacity of five or 6 lots for\\neach split. My background is process development and I used to be a big fan of corner splits and ran a\\nlot of them myself. I eventually concluded that they were not that useful for three reasons as follow: 1).\\nToo often there are parameter interactions that you cannot avoid which makes it difficult to impossible\\nto get clean results from the splits. 2). You may plan for nominal, +3 sigma and -3 sigma splits but due\\nto normal process variation you usually end up with each of these splits +/- 1 sigma or so from your\\nintended target, e.g. -1 sigma, +2 sigma and -4 sigma, which again makes analysis difficult or\\n\", metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/Lukas/Desktop/My_Projects/To_Upload/Llama2/llama2_projects/llama2_pdf_chatbot_faiss_windows/data/V2/Hotline_Wiki_v2.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

For example, often\\nCadence does not take into account all capacitances from a model, especially if it is a macro model.

To answer your question why breakdown voltage\\nparameters generally significantly different from the operating limits is that the device electrical\\nparameters are those measured either at PCM on every wafer manufactured or during a\\ncharacterization phase of the development. The min/max values being defined by the measured results\\nand then engineering experience to set the min/max limits. For breakdown voltage, these values are\\nwhen the device fails at the time of measurement. In contast the Operating Conditions are defined to\\nensure that the device will survive for 10 years.

       " Document(page_content=\"Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question if it is okay if you design\\nexceed a transistor or device operating limit is that The breakdown voltage of a transistor is a kind of\\n'digital' description of the transistor strength. But the real life is manifold. Therefore reliability tests are\\nperformed to describe the transistor strength for the real world conditions. If the operating conditions\\nare far away from the electrical limits there is no danger. But if the operating conditions get closer to the\\nelectrical limits the probability of malfunction or damage increases. Each MOS transistor consists of a\\nparasitic bipolar transistor. This parasitic bipolar transistor makes the MOS transistor sensitive to\\npulses. The sensitivity depends on many factors. On the one hand on the pulse characteristics such as\\namplitude, length, duty cycle, rise and fall time, ripple, frequency and etc. On the other hand factors\\ninclude the transistor layout such as size, construction, spacing to substrate contacts and others. There\\nis an unlimited amount of possible scenarios. This is what it makes very difficult to judge whether\\nspecial conditions can be allowed or not. Therefore only one general recommendation is to never\\nexceed the specified operating limits.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, what is the difference\\nbetween protection diodes and other diodes?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the differences\\nbetween protection diodes and other diodes is that protection diode needs to carry a relatively high\\namount of current in breakdown to really protect the circuit, otherwise the voltage drop at the device to\\nbe protected can still be too high and do damage to it. Therefore it is measured at higher currents.\\nProtection diodes are 'designed' to have a certain breakdown voltage which is defined rather by layout\\n(overlap of wells, distances) not by doping profile. Note that usually it is more a concern about the\\ncontacts and wiring when looking at the current limits, rather than the diode parameters.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, if I ignore DRC errors on\\nmy logo elements ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question if you can ignore DRC\\nerrors on your logo elements is that although a logo strucure is not a circuit element, it can be very\\ndangerous, in some cases, to waive logo DRC errors. For example, metals and/or photo-resist that are\\nbelow minimum width may float off the silicon during the processing and then get deposited elsewhere\\non the design and cause chip failures.\\nQuestion: Can you tell me, which DRC rules are\\nclassified as fatal ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding which DRC rules\\nare classified as fatal is that we do not publish a list of Fatal vs Critical errors as they are constantly\\nunder review and publication would imply that there are some errors that we don't mind the customer\\nviolating - that is not the case.

To answer your question if ELDO views for Cadence\\nPDK is available is that Unfortunately we don't support ELDO views in our Cadence PDKs. An extra\\nlicense is necessary to test such views in Cadence libraries, and we do not have that currently in\\nX-FAB, so we cannot check and guarantee the correctness of such views. In principle it might be\\npossible for a customer to use ELDO as a simulator within Cadence, although a hurdle may be the\\nnetlisting for the simulator, which may have some specific aspects different from the netlisting for\\nSpectre or for HSpice.

To answer your question if the specified current\\ndensity limits is sufficient for metal width when considering ESD is that regarding the required metal\\nwidth for ESD, usually the metal resistance is critical and not the current density/current capability of\\nthe metal. The current density for HBM ESD pulses is in the range of several hundred mA/um width for\\nexample 300-400mA/um). Only narrow metal lines would be damaged by ESD stress currents.

       " Document(page_content=\"Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question why simulations of\\ntransistor leakage produce inaccurate results that are independent of device widths is that this issue is\\nrelated to the default gmin setting of the simulator, which is gmin=1e-12. This gives every node a\\nconductivity of 1e-12 to aid convergence. That means basically it 'adds' at 1V a current of 1e-12A.\\nTherefore this is not dependent on the transistor's width.

To answer your question if X-FAB can provide IBIS\\nmodels is that X-Fab does not support IBIS models. This falls beyond the scope of X-FAB's modelling\\nand library support, as we are a pure-play wafer manufacturer. As I understand it, the IBIS model\\nprovides I/O device characteristics through I/V data and switching characteristics in ASCII format. The\\nIBIS models are meant for the transfer of data and not to define an executable simulation model. They\\nare component specific, which means that they model an entire component for example an FPGA and\\nnot just a particular I/O. IBIS models are supposed to serve for implementing the behavior of I/Os into a\\ntechnology independent PCB level EMC simulation environment. We cannot provide correct IBIS\\nmodels since we don't have all the required package and pin related data.

To answer your question why metal layers is thinner\\non the bond pad is that the Structural and Geometrical Parameters show the metal layer thicknesses as\\ndeposited. However if you have large oxide windows as are there on the bond pad structures, then the\\npad metal is thinned (etched back), and this results in thinner metal layers directly on the bonding pads.\\nSome process documents have the bond pad diagrams showing each metal layer with an ARC layer on\\ntop and below the metal. These ARC layers are relatively thin.

To answer your question regarding the the\\ndifferences, distinction between the types of body tied transistors is that there are two types of\\ntransistors available in the XI10 process, the H and A types. The A type transistors use the \\'castellated\\'\\nsource/body structure; they have the advantage that they can be made whatever width the customer\\nwants because the body contact is distributed along the source width. However, they have the\\ndisadvantage that the N+ and P+ diffusions for the source and body are touching, so there will be\\nbiasing limitations for these terminals. The xi10 S/D is not silicided, so at least there is no direct short\\nbetween the source and body in these transistors, but with the N+/P+ abutment, trying to apply different\\nvoltages to the source and body will likely result in either high leakage between the two terminals or\\noutright breakdown as this structure is effectively a surface Zener diode. The H type transistors place\\nthe body contacts of the transistors at the ends of the channel and separate the P+ and N+ diffusions\\nby a cross connection of poly to the gate (the designation \\'H\\' transistors comes from the resulting shape\\nof the poly gate). The advantage of these devices is that with the diffusions separated no parasitic\\nZener diode is formed, so leakage and breakdown between the source and body will not be an issue.\\nThe disadvantage of these devices is that due to body resistance perpendicular to the channel, the ratio\\nof W/L is limited for the devices to 6 for the nmos and 12 for the pmos devices.\\n', metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/Lukas/Desktop/My_Projects/To_Upload/Llama2/llama2_projects/llama2_pdf_chatbot_faiss_windows/data/V2/Hotline_Wiki_v2.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

To answer your question regarding after upgrading\\nto version 12 PDK, why do rpp1 instances of existing design show different parameter values that flag\\nand trigger B7P1 design rule violations is that this is due to the underlying well options. The background\\nhere is that we found a bimodal distribution of rpp1 sheet resistance with NWELL below, depending on\\nwhether LP5MOS or MOS5 core module was used. To address this, we now offer two rpp1_3 resistor\\ntypes: the rpp1_3 and a rpp1nw_3. The rpp1_3 has a new higher sheet resistance than before while\\nthe rpp1nw_3 has the same sheet resistance as the version 11 rpp1_3. This explains why, using\\nrpp1_3, you get a different length for the same resistance in v12 PDK. You could use the new device\\nrpp1nw_3 instead of rpp1_3 to get a better match to the old v11 and avoid the B7P1 error.
