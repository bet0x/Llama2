diode forward bias operation,"In general we don't support forward biasing of diodes in our technologies (unless specifically stated - such as Schottky diodes). Mostly this is because the diode model parameters are chosen such that the reverse operation of the diode can be accurately simulated. This does not mean that the  simulation of the diodes in forward direction is totally wrong, but it can be less accurate. To model a diode in forward direction often requires parameters that are not available in the model or are insufficiently supported. You can simulate in forward direction and you will get a typical diode characteristic which is fairly accurate in the low current range but may be less accurate in the high current range (knee current, series resistance). In some of our documents is the statement that ""forward bias is not modeled"" which is based on this lack of accuracy in the models. The parameters describing the diode in forward bias are also very layout-specific, so an accurate model for a diode in forward bias would have to be related to a fixed layout.","###Human:

Do the I/O libraries support copper wire bonding?,"We do not have any I/O libraries specifically designed for Cu bonding. Some customers have reported running into problems with copper wire bonding but in at least some cases, different customers have used exactly the same pad structure and one had no problem while the other had issues. This indicates different assembly houses can have quite different bonding parameters, and as copper wire bonding is a harsher process than gold or aluminum bonding, marginalities in the interaction between the process and bonding are more likely to show up. One suggestion is to consider using the thick metal (METTHK) module to give the widest bonding margin for assembly - and don't use in conjunction with circuit-under-pad techniques. If thick metal is not or cannot be used, inform your assembly partner of the top metal thickness. ","###Human:

Please explain the usage of Page 2 (Safety area).,"Let  me clarify a couple of comments on the datasheet:

'if power supply interruption during store is impossible.' -
The background is that the trim bits for the charge pump are stored in page 2. The trim bits are determined and stored during wafer probe 1. The trim bits control the programming and erase behavior (timing, pulses, programming and erase voltage level,…) of the Store operation. If the trim bits do not have the correct value, the endurance and data retention cannot be guaranteed. Any power supply interruption (for example brown-outs) during Store operation could lead to corrupted non-volatile data, because the Store is not executed/finished correctly. Such scenarios are very application dependent. General recommendation is to store critical data (like the trim bits) on page 2 during wafer probe/final test and do no further Store operation to page 2 during the application. If the correct power supply and a correct Store can be guaranteed, storing to page 2 can also be done.

'If no customer safety relevant data have to be stored it is sufficient to use the maximum size of page 1.' --
In the compiler web interface on myXFAB, the page size (WORDS_PAGE1) can be customized (the restrictions are visible in the compiler web interface). If there are very few or no further critical data (as described above) except the NVRAM trim bits, the page 2 size can be minimized to not waste area.","###Human:

Which antenna diode should be use?,"The connection to DIFF provides a discharge path during manufacture, so its function as an antenna diode doesn't matter which diode is used.

"Concerning device operating limits, what do the 'absolute' voltage limits specify?","For X-FAB, the absolute voltage is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a device for a short period of time without significant damage.  The main reason we phrase it this way is because we can't be sure what the actual state of the device will be during this period of time.
For example, if 7 volts is applied between the source and drain of a nmos4 device from the xc06 process (7V is the absolute max value for these terminals) we are not specifying what voltage is on the gate or body of the device.  If the gate and body were at 0V, this voltage could probably be held 'forever,' but if the body was at 0V and the gate was at 2V, there would be significant hot carrier current to the gate and the device could fairly quickly degrade. Since this is a circuit issue, we have to use the conservative definition. 
If in your designs you can guarantee that the devices are always off when the maximum voltage is applied, the devices will probably survive indefinitely. However, please remember that X-FAB will not guarantee this.","###Human:

What are your recommendations for corner lot splits?,"The short answer is that unlike most digital-dominated fabs, we don't have a set menu of split conditions based on fast / typ / slow that customers should choose because in a mixed signal design there is often a lot more than just Vt and poly CD that can be critical to the design (but those parameters would normally be sufficient for a digital design). Therefore it's normal for a customer to make a specific request on what parameters it is desired to adjust and the relevant fab will review and confirm if that set of corners is possible. The negotiation would be done through Customer Projects at the relevant fab.

Our digital libraries and memories are characterized in the process fast/slow 3 Sigma range. 3 Sigma production means that 99.73% of the delivered wafers are OK in terms of the stable process parameters.
The process parameters are monitored with PCM test structures on each wafer.
So, if your digital design is DRC, LVS clean and the timing analysis with post layout extraction is OK at the conditions:
PVT = wp(fast), VDD_max, Tj_min
PVT = ws(slow), VDD_min, Tj_max
then you can expect 99.73% yield of the digital block in terms of process parameter deviations.
 
The majority of our customers don't ask for corner lots for their projects, but some customers do it. The Vt and gate length adjustments implied by your proposed corners impact the relevant transistor parameters for digital timing which are saturation current and threshold voltage.

The usual flow for ordering corner lots begins with the customer identifying the critical process parameters for their design (might not be simply 'digital' parameters) and submitting a list of required corners (must conform to the PCM pass/fail parameters) to X-FAB. The feasibility of such process variations will be checked by X-FAB (Customer Projects team) and then a final corner split proposal is sent. 

The goal of such a corner should be to evaluate that the design would work at lower and upper spec limits. So the typical values are the upper and lower limits of the PCM Acceptance Specification (PAS).

Here are some comments that have been collected from one of our FSEs:

    If you design according to the design rules, then the simulations should be sufficient.
    Some products require that the design rules be pushed to meet the performance requirements. In these cases, corner lots can identify process sensitivities where yield can be compromised.
    I would estimate that less than 10% of my customers are relying on Corner Lots for characterization, and these are generally only for high-volume products. When they do request they typically look at simple VTN/VTP, maybe HiRes Poly. The parameters are really design dependent. Even when I do get customers running corner lots, I’m not getting much feedback and request for product specific parametric targeting. This leads to my perception about the accuracy of the simulations.
    Potentially more effective than corner lots is coordinating a yield feedback loop once products are released to production. If we get your yield, bin, etc. information and input it into our yield enhancement software, we can correlate to equipment, inline, PCM, visual inspection, etc. Customers that work with us on this feedback will achieve yield stabilization much more quickly than without. We can work with you to review your Wafer/Final Test and coordinate the best means for yield feedback.

One of our application engineers expanded on those comments:

    The customers that do request corner lots usually settle on +/-3 sigma for the parameters they are interested in. The LV MOS VT parameters are usually selected. Beyond that it really depends on the specifics of the process options the customer has chosen and the sensitivities their designers are most concerned with.
    However, there are some significant limitations on what parameters can be varied cleanly in a corner split. The LV MOS VT parameters are relatively straight forward because there is usually a separate VT adjust implant used on them that is separate from the well implant that controls breakdown and punch through, however there are usually a few interactions that can’t be avoided (like output resistance and nw sheet resistance). The high sheet resistance poly resistors are generally easy to vary because there is usually a dedicated implant for that parameter. Beyond that things get more difficult. The HV transistor VT is sometimes split but there is almost always an interaction with transistor BVDSS, punch through, sometimes field threshold and often other parameters which can complicate evaluating the split. Other parameters are very difficult or expensive to split such as gate oxide thickness or capacitor values because they require dedicated diffusion or deposition runs that use the capacity of five or 6 lots for each split.
    My background is process development and I used to be a big fan of corner splits and ran a lot of them myself. I eventually concluded that they were not that useful for three reasons:

1. Too often there are parameter interactions that you cannot avoid which makes it difficult to impossible to get clean results from the splits.

2. You may plan for nominal, +3 sigma and -3 sigma splits but due to normal process variation you usually end up with each of these splits +/- 1 sigma or so from your intended target, e.g. -1 sigma, +2 sigma and -4 sigma, which again makes analysis difficult or impossible and may result in some splits being non-functional.

3. The corner splits are arranged by artificially varying one process parameter, such as the VT implant. In actual production lots each device parameter varies 'naturally' due to the interaction of several different process parameters. Each of these parameters has a different magnitude and direction impact on several different device parameters, usually for several different devices. As a result multiple device parameters tend to vary in a complex but related way. The corner split procedure does not reproduce this pattern so while you may get the target parameter to vary the way you want, the other device parameters will vary in a completely different way than you will see in actual production lots. For digital blocks this is probably not an important issue but for analog or RF blocks it may give a completely misleading result.
I hope this input is helpful in your decision-making.","###Human:

You may plan for nominal, +3 sigma and -3 sigma splits but due to normal process variation you usually end up with each of these splits +/- 1 sigma or so from your intended target, e.g. -1 sigma, +2 sigma and -4 sigma, which again makes analysis difficult or impossible and may result in some splits being non-functional.

3. The corner splits are arranged by artificially varying one process parameter, such as the VT implant. In actual production lots each device parameter varies 'naturally' due to the interaction of several different process parameters. Each of these parameters has a different magnitude and direction impact on several different device parameters, usually for several different devices. As a result multiple device parameters tend to vary in a complex but related way. The corner split procedure does not reproduce this pattern so while you may get the target parameter to vary the way you want, the other device parameters will vary in a completely different way than you will see in actual production lots. For digital blocks this is probably not an important issue but for analog or RF blocks it may give a completely misleading result.
I hope this input is helpful in your decision-making."
Can X-FAB processes be used at cryogenic temperatures?,"X-FAB generally does not have data at low temperatures below our operating range limits. We do have customers that use our technologies outside of our specified operating temperature limits, but in such cases the customer is responsible for qualifying the design in their application's temperature range.
You may have noticed that the PDS states that the simulation models are valid in the junction temperature range down to -55C. As example, the XH018 PDS also specifies:
The junction temperature range is defined as:
Operating conditions: Tj = -40C  +175C
Absolute maximum ratings: Tj = -55C / +185C
In general we are not aware of any specific process problems with operating down to -55C, however, we also say absolute max ratings must not be sustained for long periods (hence why customers need to perform their own qualification). For the range down to -55C, we can only mention some qualitative aspects. These cannot be quantified or supported by real measurement results because we neither characterize nor qualify to that temperature. Possible trends are:
1) HCI drift may get worse - but it may be mitigated because in the state where HCI is happening, current is flowing, and the transistor sees some self-heating.
2) The transistor junction breakdown voltages could be slightly reduced.

Clearly 77K (-196C) is significantly beyond our absolute minimum operating range, so full characterization/qualification on your side will be necessary to ensure you have a robust product. I am no expert in such low temperatures but I have heard of terms such as carrier freeze out which can come into play, but such issues only amplify the requirement to do the characterization and qualification.

X-FAB does not have the capability (or business justification) to offer such low temperature characterization (below -40C) so I'm afraid we cannot help you in that respect.

I'm not really aware of a third party who could do such work either, although I'd suggest you look at our partner network (see X-CHAIN on our website) in case you can make some contacts there. Perhaps one of the Test/Assembly companies could be of interest.

You might also consider trying to talk to a Space company (or their suppliers if you know who they might be) to see if they can do this or put you in touch with someone who can.","###Human:

What exactly does the ESD module do and why is it not available for all MOS devices if it improves ESD robustness?,"Usually in older technology nodes such as CX08, the ESD implant of the ESD module is added to aid with a vertical 'spike' issue that occurs under high current (such as an ESD pulse) when the aluminum (which is slightly p-type) in the contact can 'spike' through the n-junction and short it to the P-bulk below. The ESD (n-type) implant is deeper than the normal n-junction, preventing a short from occurring. The p-junction is not shorted out in the same circumstance, so ESD implant is not needed on p-devices.","###Human:

Is it okay if I exceed a transistor's operating limit by such-and-such amount?,"The BV of a transistor is a kind of 'digital' description of the transistor strength. But the real life is manifold.

Each MOS transistor consists of a parasitic bipolar transistor. This parasitic bipolar transistor makes the MOS transistor sensitive to pulses. The sensitivity depends on many factors. On the one hand on the pulse characteristics (amplitude, length, duty cycle, rise and fall time, ripple, frequency, etc.). On the other hand factors include the transistor layout (size, construction, spacing to substrate contacts, etc.). There is an unlimited amount of possible scenarios.

"Should I include pattern in my design, or will X-FAB perform the pattern fill?","For technologies that specify density limits and include one or more blocking layers for the fill, the fab will perform it.

It is also possible to have the runset export the dummies to GDS such that you could merge it with your design. The problem with the dummy generation is that all structures are flat, which results in larger GDS files. Therefore it is recommended to let our Mask Tooling group do the pattern fill.
For capacitively critical structures, relevant metal layers only should be blocked rather than using the BLKALL layer.
The parasitic extraction runsets can C-extract these structures for determining their impact on the performance.
The fill routines observe spacing margin and dummy size rules -- one consequence of that is the fill routine is not guaranteed to satisfy the minimum density rules. When that's the case, you may need to apply some extra effort, such as manually drawing a denser fill pattern.","###Human:

Are the specified current density limits sufficient for metal width when considering ESD?,"Regarding the required metal width for ESD, usually the metal resistance is critical and not the current density/current capability of the metal. The current density for HBM ESD pulses is in the range of several hundred mA/um width (e.g. 300-400mA/um). Only narrow metal lines would be damaged by ESD stress currents. 

The metal resistance is critical since voltage drops across power rails will add to the pad clamping voltage. Especially in the rail-based protection scheme the power rail resistance is critical. Concerning the power rail width, power rails should provide as rule of thumb a DC current capability of 50mA for 2kV HBM ESD robustness.

A different metal resistance in the connections of multi-finger ESD protection devices can result in non-uniform current distribution and early failure of the ESD protection structure. Typical layout errors are e.g. largely different metal width in anode and cathode metal connections of diodes resulting in a current concentration in a small area of the diode or a largely different metal width between drain metal and source metal in ESD nmos snap-back devices resulting as well in non-uniform current distribution.","###Human:

"Comparing the metal thicknesses of the bond pad stack to those of the Structural and Geometrical Parameters, why are the metal layers thinner on the bond pad?","The Structural and Geometrical Parameters show the metal layer thicknesses as deposited. However if you have large oxide windows as are there on the bond pad structures, then the pad metal is thinned (etched back), and this results in thinner metal layers directly on the bonding pads. Some process documents have the bond pad diagrams showing each metal layer with an ARC layer on top and below the metal. These ARC layers are relatively thin. The deposited thickness parameters include the ARC layers since they affect the stack thickness and hence all the parasitic capacitances.

What is the difference between the types of body tied transistors?,"There are two types of transistors available in the XI10 process, the H and A types.
The A type transistors use the 'castellated' source/body structure; they have the advantage that they can be made whatever width the customer wants because the body contact is distributed along the source width. However, they have the disadvantage that the N+ and P+ diffusions for the source and body are touching, so there will be biasing limitations for these terminals. The xi10 S/D is not silicided, so at least there is no direct short between the source and body in these transistors, but with the N+/P+ abutment, trying to apply different voltages to the source and body will likely result in either high leakage between the two terminals or outright breakdown as this structure is effectively a surface Zener diode.
The H type transistors place the body contacts of the transistors at the ends of the channel and separate the P+ and N+ diffusions by a cross connection of poly to the gate (the designation 'H' transistors comes from the resulting shape of the poly gate). The advantage of these devices is that with the diffusions separated no parasitic Zener diode is formed, so leakage and breakdown between the source and body will not be an issue. The disadvantage of these devices is that due to body resistance perpendicular to the channel, the ratio of W/L is limited for the devices to 6 for the nmos and 12 for the pmos devices.","###Human:

However, they have the disadvantage that the N+ and P+ diffusions for the source and body are touching, so there will be biasing limitations for these terminals. The xi10 S/D is not silicided, so at least there is no direct short between the source and body in these transistors, but with the N+/P+ abutment, trying to apply different voltages to the source and body will likely result in either high leakage between the two terminals or outright breakdown as this structure is effectively a surface Zener diode.
The H type transistors place the body contacts of the transistors at the ends of the channel and separate the P+ and N+ diffusions by a cross connection of poly to the gate (the designation 'H' transistors comes from the resulting shape of the poly gate). The advantage of these devices is that with the diffusions separated no parasitic Zener diode is formed, so leakage and breakdown between the source and body will not be an issue. The disadvantage of these devices is that due to body resistance perpendicular to the channel, the ratio of W/L is limited for the devices to 6 for the nmos and 12 for the pmos devices."

The 'dn' model is a subckt model consisting of level1 diode models with different ideality factors. In this model the different diodes are used to model the current forward/reverse over temperature. With respect to the diode current the process variation is solely covered by changing the 'is' parameter in the model and the ideality factor is unchanged. Usually the diode current consists of an ideal and a non-ideal part and the ratio of both can change with process variation (the non-ideal part is fluctuating, while the ideal part is very stable). Changing the ideality factor in the model would lead to a large deviation of the current over temperature, which we do not observe, but we only have limited data from a statistical point of view (only lab measurements over T). It is safer to avoid using this device for high precision applications like bandgaps because the forward voltage variation is not measured by PCM test and therefore also the corner models will not be as accurate as needed for this purpose.","###Human:

What is the handle wafer contact resistance?,"It is in the 10 kOhm range.

"After upgrading to version 12 PDK, why do rpp1 instances of existing design show different parameter values and get flagged with DRC error B7P1?","This is due to the underlying well options. The background here is that we found a bimodal distribution of rpp1 sheet resistance with NWELL below, depending on whether LP5MOS or MOS5 core module was used. To address this, we now offer two rpp1_3 resistor types: the rpp1_3 and a rpp1nw_3. The rpp1_3 has a new higher sheet resistance than before while the rpp1nw_3 has the same sheet resistance as the version 11 rpp1_3.

This explains why, using rpp1_3, you get a different length for the same resistance in v12 PDK.

You could use the new device rpp1nw_3 instead of rpp1_3 to get a better match to the old v11 and avoid the B7P1 error.

Alternatively, you could leave your layout as-is and waive the B7P1 error as it is not fatal, but then if the design is re-used in a different core module later, you may see a different performance.","###Human:
