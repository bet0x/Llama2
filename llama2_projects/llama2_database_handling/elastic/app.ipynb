To answer your question regarding the the differences, distinction between the types of body tied transistors is that there are two types of transistors available in the XI10 process, the H and A types. The A type transistors use the 'castellated' source/body structure; they have the advantage that they can be made whatever width the customer wants because the body contact is distributed along the source width. However, they have the disadvantage that the N+ and P+ diffusions for the source and body are touching, so there will be biasing limitations for these terminals. The xi10 S/D is not silicided, so at least there is no direct short between the source and body in these transistors, but with the N+/P+ abutment, trying to apply different voltages to the source and body will likely result in either high leakage between the two terminals or outright breakdown as this structure is effectively a surface Zener diode. The H type transistors place the body contacts of the transistors at the ends of the channel and separate the P+ and N+ diffusions by a cross connection of poly to the gate (the designation 'H' transistors comes from the resulting shape of the poly gate). The advantage of these devices is that with the diffusions separated no parasitic Zener diode is formed, so leakage and breakdown between the source and body will not be an issue. The disadvantage of these devices is that due to body resistance perpendicular to the channel, the ratio of W/L is limited for the devices to 6 for the nmos and 12 for the pmos devices.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_100_00101.txt'}), Document(page_content='Question: Can you tell me, how should the poly ring of diodes be biased ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I\\'d be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on how should the poly ring of diodes be biased is that due to its lateral construction, the diode is different from pure bulk junction diodes in other processes.\\nYou might review the Device Characteristics Documentation you can either download the package or browse online by clicking the globe icon to see how the poly ring potential influences the current.\\nCan check this link \"https://my.xfab.com/search/_action/relation/96b7577d-f3b9-40e3-b81f-27cee2e35705/\". The \\'dn\\' model is a subckt model consisting of level1 diode models with different ideality factors. In this model the different diodes are used to model the current forward/reverse over temperature. With respect to the diode current the process variation is solely covered by changing the \\'is\\' parameter in the model and the ideality factor is unchanged. Usually the diode current consists of an ideal and a non-ideal part and the ratio of both can change with process variation (the non-ideal part is fluctuating, while the ideal part is very stable). Changing the ideality factor in the model would lead to a large deviation of the current over temperature, which we do not observe, but we only have limited data from a statistical point of view (only lab measurements over T). It is safer to avoid using this device for high precision applications like bandgaps because the forward voltage variation is not measured by PCM test and therefore also the corner models will not be as accurate as needed for this purpose.\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_101_00102.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, What is the handle wafer contact resistance ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

Several transistors such as nhvta, nhvtb, nhvu, ndhvt, ndhvta, phvta, phvtb and phvu need a handle wafer connection for simulation. The fifth terminal 'HW' of these transistors is used for this. It is necessary to connect this terminal in schematic and layout. LVS checks this connection. The connection of the handle wafer can be realized by a top side or a back side connection.

To answer your question why  XT018 or xt018 HV_CELLS library are not automatically loaded because the module requirements can differ depending on the selected cell -- this applies mainly to the 1.8V cells as they are not compatible with the MOS5 core module. In the Cadence PDK environment, whether an X-FAB library is available for a particular PDK startup option is controlled by the pdk_code.txt file within the library. The file currently in the library only specifies options with the LP5MOS main module. However, the library can also be used with the MOS5 main module (except the 1.8V cells, as already noted). The pdk_code.txt file can be amended as below to include MOS5, which specifies the compatible options. Change the file in your installed library at (the exact path depends on the library version) $X_DIR/xt018/esdlibs/HV_CELLS/v1_2/cadence_IC61/v1_2_0/HV_CELLS/ with the content below.

To answer your question regarding after upgrading to version 12 PDK, why do rpp1 instances of existing design show different parameter values that  flag and trigger B7P1 design rule violations is that this is due to the underlying well options. The background here is that we found a bimodal distribution of rpp1 sheet resistance with NWELL below, depending on whether LP5MOS or MOS5 core module was used. To address this, we now offer two rpp1_3 resistor types: the rpp1_3 and a rpp1nw_3. The rpp1_3 has a new higher sheet resistance than before while the rpp1nw_3 has the same sheet resistance as the version 11 rpp1_3. This explains why, using rpp1_3, you get a different length for the same resistance in v12 PDK. You could use the new device rpp1nw_3 instead of rpp1_3 to get a better match to the old v11 and avoid the B7P1 error. Alternatively, you could leave your layout as-is and waive the B7P1 error as it is not fatal, but then if the design is re-used in a different core module later, you may see a different performance.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_110_00111.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, What is the relation, coorelation of FIMP mask to drawn layers ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

To answer your question regarding at what step are the wafers actually held or stop especially for wafer held at poly is that for a request to hold at Poly, we will hold it at Active (ACT/DIFF) layer instead. For the 0.18um technologies, ACT and POLY1 dummies are required and both dummies are interlinked. Therefore, any POLY1 redesign may affect the ACT layer and may result in a new ACT mask.

To answer your question the usage of fifth terminal of HW handle wafer terminal is that several transistors such as nhvta, nhvtb, nhvu, ndhvt, ndhvta, phvta, phvtb and phvu need a handle wafer connection for simulation. The fifth terminal 'HW' of these transistors is used for this. It is necessary to connect this terminal in schematic and layout. LVS checks this connection. The connection of the handle wafer can be realized by a top side or a back side connection. In case of top side connection the HWC module is to be used.

To answer your question regarding of diode forward bias operation in X-Fab,  In general we don\\'t support forward biasing of diodes in our technologies unless specifically stated such as Schottky diodes. Mostly this is because the diode model parameters are chosen such that the reverse operation of the diode can be accurately simulated. This does not mean that the  simulation of the diodes in forward direction is totally wrong, but it can be less accurate. To model a diode in forward direction often requires parameters that are not available in the model or are insufficiently supported. You can simulate in forward direction and you will get a typical diode characteristic which is fairly accurate in the low current range but may be less accurate in the high current range (knee current, series resistance). In some of our documents is the statement that \"forward bias is not modeled\" which is based on this lack of accuracy in the models. The parameters describing the diode in forward bias are also very layout-specific, so an accurate model for a diode in forward bias would have to be related to a fixed layout.\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_18_00019.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, Can you show me on how tospecify an alpha PDK with xkit ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

Some customers have reported running into problems with copper wire bonding but in at least some cases, different customers have used exactly the same pad structure and one had no problem while the other had issues. This indicates different assembly houses can have quite different bonding parameters, and as copper wire bonding is a harsher process than gold or aluminum bonding, marginalities in the interaction between the process and bonding are more likely to show up.

To answer your question on how to implement multiple instances of a ROM each with different programming is that  when  you are instantiating multiple instances of the same ROM configuration but with different programmings, it is necessary to use the 'extended name' option on the front-end compiler so that each separate instance has a unique name. Otherwise, when IP replacement is performed, both instances will be identical. The distinct names will be used by the backend compiler so that the top cell name of the generated ROM block will be distinct. Otherwise the cal files submitted will be the same with identical top cell names. Then, even though your blackbox cell names are necessarily different, if we were to proceed with the IP replacement, the result would be all ROMs with the same programming. Thus to ensure each ROM instance will have the desired programming, generate the front-end data from the compiler using the extended name option to specify a unique name for each ROM.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_33_00034.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me and explain the usage of Page 2 of Safety area ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding  the usage of Page 2 of Safety area, First, let  me clarify a couple of comments on the datasheet, if power supply interruption during store is impossible then the background is that the trim bits for the charge pump are stored in page 2. The trim bits are determined and stored during wafer probe 1. The trim bits control the programming and erase behavior (timing, pulses, programming and erase voltage level) of the Store operation. If the trim bits do not have the correct value, the endurance and data retention cannot be guaranteed. Any power supply interruption (for example brown-outs)\\xa0during Store operation could lead to corrupted non-volatile data, because the Store is not executed and finished correctly. Such scenarios are very application dependent. General recommendation is to store critical data like the trim bits on page 2 during wafer probe and final test and do no further Store operation to page 2 during the application. If the correct power supply and a correct Store can be guaranteed, storing to page 2 can also be done. Secondly, If no customer safety relevant data have to be stored it is sufficient to use the maximum size of page 1. In the compiler web interface on myXFAB, the page size (WORDS_PAGE1) can be customized (the restrictions are visible in the compiler web interface). If there are very few or no further critical data as described above except the NVRAM trim bits, the page 2 size can be minimized to not waste area.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_34_00035.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, why Q1SU DRC flags or trigger ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

After manufacture, the antenna role is no longer needed, and how the diode could impact the function of the circuit must dictate which diode is selected. Rather than the breakdown voltage parameter, the reverse bias operating limit should be used to decide. Alternatively, where possible, a metal bridge close to the at-risk gate oxide can be used to fix an antenna violation.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_38_00039.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, concerning device operating limits, what do is the meaning of  absolute'voltage limits and what it is specify ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question concerning device operating limits and what is the meaning of  absolute'voltage limits, In general for X-FAB, the absolute voltage is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a device for a short period of time without significant damage.  The main reason we phrase it this way is because we can't be sure what the actual state of the device will be during this period of time. For example, if 7 volts is applied between the source and drain of a nmos4 device from the xc06 process 7V is the absolute max value for these terminals. We are not specifying what voltage is on the gate or body of the device.  If the gate and body were at 0V, this voltage could probably be held forever. But if the body was at 0V and the gate was at 2V, there would be significant hot carrier current to the gate and the device could fairly quickly degrade. Since this is a circuit issue, we have to use the conservative definition. If in your designs you can guarantee that the devices are always off when the maximum voltage is applied, the devices will probably survive indefinitely. However, please remember that X-FAB will not guarantee this.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_39_00040.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, what is DMIM antenna DRC flag debugging ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

To answer your question regarding the meaning of the Assura 'minority PTUB connectors' error message is that It is generated by the connect statement from Assura. It means that more than one net is connected to the layer. The stamped layer receives the net information from the net with the most contacts. All other nets are marked with this error. For more detailed information please refer to the Assura manuals. X-FAB does not document tool specific messages. The Assura Command Reference manual (a document primarily aimed at runset developers) explains that: 'A layer with a soft connection is a layer that only receives connectivity information and does not pass on that connectivity information. You can use the soft keyword to check layers for high-resistivity, such as wells, where you want them to be part of the net, but you do not want them to be used as a connection between two conducting layers. This means PTUB_soft_connect errors are 'soft connection' shorts through a common layer, which is often the PSUB, or a common well. In other words, multiple distinct nets are connected to that common layer. Perhaps those distinct nets were not intended to be distinct and should be connected together by metal.

To answer your question regarding recommendations for corner lot splits is that the short answer is that unlike most digital-dominated fabs, we don't have a set menu of split conditions based on fast / typ / slow that customers should choose because in a mixed signal design there is often a lot more than just Vt and poly CD that can be critical to the design (but those parameters would normally be sufficient for a digital design). Therefore it's normal for a customer to make a specific request on what parameters it is desired to adjust and the relevant fab will review and confirm if that set of corners is possible. The negotiation would be done through Customer Projects at the relevant fab. Our digital libraries and memories are characterized in the process fast/slow 3 Sigma range. 3 Sigma production means that 99.73% of the delivered wafers are OK in terms of the stable process parameters. The process parameters are monitored with PCM test structures on each wafer. So, if your digital design is DRC, LVS clean and the timing analysis with post layout extraction is OK at the conditions as follow:\\n\\n1). PVT = wp(fast), VDD_max, Tj_min\\n2). PVT = ws(slow), VDD_min, Tj_max\\n\\nthen you can expect 99.73% yield of the digital block in terms of process parameter deviations. The majority of our customers don't ask for corner lots for their projects, but some customers do it. The Vt and gate length adjustments implied by your proposed corners impact the relevant transistor parameters for digital timing which are saturation current and threshold voltage. The usual flow for ordering corner lots begins with the customer identifying the critical process parameters for their design (might not be simply 'digital' parameters) and submitting a list of required corners (must conform to the PCM pass/fail parameters) to X-FAB. The feasibility of such process variations will be checked by X-FAB (Customer Projects team) and then a final corner split proposal is sent.  The goal of such a corner should be to evaluate that the design would work at lower and upper spec limits. So the typical values are the upper and lower limits of the PCM Acceptance Specification (PAS). Here are some comments that have been collected from one of our FSEs. If you design according to the design rules, then the simulations should be sufficient. Some products require that the design rules be pushed to meet the performance requirements. In these cases, corner lots can identify process sensitivities where yield can be compromised. I would estimate that less than 10% of my customers are relying on Corner Lots for characterization, and these are generally only for high-volume products. When they do request they typically look at simple VTN/VTP, maybe HiRes Poly. The parameters are really design dependent. Even when I do get customers running corner lots, I'm not getting much feedback and request for product specific parametric targeting. This leads to my perception about the accuracy of the simulations. Potentially more effective than corner lots is coordinating a yield feedback loop once products are released to production. If we get your yield, bin, etc. information and input it into our yield enhancement software, we can correlate to equipment, inline, PCM, visual inspection, etc. Customers that work with us on this feedback will achieve yield stabilization much more quickly than without. We can work with you to review your Wafer/Final Test and coordinate the best means for yield feedback. One of our application engineers expanded on those comments, The customers that do request corner lots usually settle on +/-3 sigma for the parameters they are interested in. The LV MOS VT parameters are usually selected. Beyond that it really depends on the specifics of the process options the customer has chosen and the sensitivities their designers are most concerned with. However, there are some significant limitations on what parameters can be varied cleanly in a corner split. The LV MOS VT parameters are relatively straight forward because there is usually a separate VT adjust implant used on them that is separate from the well implant that controls breakdown and punch through, however there are usually a few interactions that cant be avoided (like output resistance and nw sheet resistance). The high sheet resistance poly resistors are generally easy to vary because there is usually a dedicated implant for that parameter. Beyond that things get more difficult. The HV transistor VT is sometimes split but there is almost always an interaction with transistor BVDSS, punch through, sometimes field threshold and often other parameters which can complicate evaluating the split. Other parameters are very difficult or expensive to split such as gate oxide thickness or capacitor values because they require dedicated diffusion or deposition runs that use the capacity of five or 6 lots for each split. My background is process development and I used to be a big fan of corner splits and ran a lot of them myself. I eventually concluded that they were not that useful for three reasons as follow:\\n\\n1). Too often there are parameter interactions that you cannot avoid which makes it difficult to impossible to get clean results from the splits.\\n2).  You may plan for nominal, +3 sigma and -3 sigma splits but due to normal process variation you usually end up with each of these splits +/- 1 sigma or so from your intended target, e.g. -1 sigma, +2 sigma and -4 sigma, which again makes analysis difficult or impossible and may result in some splits being non-functional.\\n\\n* The corner splits are arranged by artificially varying one process parameter, such as the VT implant. In actual production lots each device parameter varies 'naturally' due to the interaction of several different process parameters. Each of these parameters has a different magnitude and direction impact on several different device parameters, usually for several different devices. As a result multiple device parameters tend to vary in a complex but related way. The corner split procedure does not reproduce this pattern so while you may get the target parameter to vary the way you want, the other device parameters will vary in a completely different way than you will see in actual production lots. For digital blocks this is probably not an important issue but for analog or RF blocks it may give a completely misleading result.

To answer your question if it is okay if you design exceed a transistor or device operating limit is that The breakdown voltage of a transistor is a kind of 'digital' description of the transistor strength. But the real life is manifold. Therefore reliability tests are performed to describe the transistor strength for the real world conditions. If the operating conditions are far away from the electrical limits there is no danger. But if the operating conditions get closer to the electrical limits the probability of malfunction or damage increases. Each MOS transistor consists of a parasitic bipolar transistor. This parasitic bipolar transistor makes the MOS transistor sensitive to pulses. The sensitivity depends on many factors. On the one hand on the pulse characteristics such as amplitude, length, duty cycle, rise and fall time, ripple, frequency and etc. On the other hand factors include the transistor layout such as size, construction, spacing to substrate contacts and others. There is an unlimited amount of possible scenarios. This is what it makes very difficult to judge whether special conditions can be allowed or not.

To answer your question regarding  the purpose of the technology libraries with an 'HD' suffix is that Using xh018 as example, TECH_XH018 is the primary technology library to use. TECH_XH018_HD is a supplementary library, to be used in addition to TECH_X018, when the HD high density logic libraries D_CELLS_*HD are used. It accounts for the tighter routing grid used by the HD logic libraries for P&R or place and routes. Originally, the HD tech library was developed as a supplementary library, meaning both the normal and HD libraries should be used referenced by a design library using an HD logic library for P&R. We then decided to make the HD tech library more complete such that on the HD tech lib needed to be referenced by the design library. In such case, if you try to reference both tech libs, you will get a conflict error.

In principle it might be possible for a customer to use ELDO as a simulator within Cadence, although a hurdle may be the netlisting for the simulator, which may have some specific aspects different from the netlisting for Spectre or for HSpice.

To answer your question if the specified current density limits is sufficient for metal width when considering ESD is that regarding the required metal width for ESD, usually the metal resistance is critical and not the current density/current capability of the metal. The current density for HBM ESD pulses is in the range of several hundred mA/um width for example 300-400mA/um). Only narrow metal lines would be damaged by ESD stress currents. The metal resistance is critical since voltage drops across power rails will add to the pad clamping voltage. Especially in the rail-based protection scheme the power rail resistance is critical. Concerning the power rail width, power rails should provide as rule of thumb a DC current capability of 50mA for 2kV HBM ESD robustness. A different metal resistance in the connections of multi-finger ESD protection devices can result in non-uniform current distribution and early failure of the ESD protection structure. Typical layout errors are e.g. largely different metal width in anode and cathode metal connections of diodes resulting in a current concentration in a small area of the diode or a largely different metal width between drain metal and source metal in ESD nmos snap-back devices resulting as well in non-uniform current distribution.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\AI_CTS\\\\Llama2\\\\Processing_Tools\\\\Data_Set_Json_To_Txt\\\\data_split\\\\output_66_00067.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Question: Can you tell me, what is FLATPV and SFLATPV ?\\nAnswer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it.

To answer your question why metal layers is thinner on the bond pad is that the Structural and Geometrical Parameters show the metal layer thicknesses as deposited. However if you have large oxide windows as are there on the bond pad structures, then the pad metal is thinned (etched back), and this results in thinner metal layers directly on the bonding pads. Some process documents have the bond pad diagrams showing each metal layer with an ARC layer on top and below the metal. These ARC layers are relatively thin. The deposited thickness parameters include the ARC layers since they affect the stack thickness and hence all the parasitic capacitances. When the passivation window is opened onto the top metal, the final ARC layer is removed.

To answer your question regarding when you try to fix rule W5M1 Minimum MET1 width joining wide MET1 track errors and obtain some inexplicable errors  because this rule is marked in red in the specification, which means it cannot be 100% reliably checked by verification decks. The rule requires sizing operations on layers that can produce artifacts on non-orthogonal shapes. That's why the rule is unselected by default in the runset. It can be activated and it provides some assistance but it is the user's final responsibility to check manually.

To answer your question regarding the purpose, intent and meaning of design rule S2TR  is that the S2TR rule was implemented to ensure that floating tubs were always built the same way.  It applies to nested trench rings used in the MUTRIS core for device isolation and its intent was to prevent engineers from placing contacts between these rings because for the isolation in the MUTRIS core to work properly these silicon tubs must be floating.

To answer your question regarding the SPICE model libraries that include *_bjt models for some MOS devices and what it is for, In short the purpose of the added PNP bipolars to the *_bjt models is to show that there can occur bipolar effects under certain conditions, but it is by far not very accurate and it has limitations. It is nevertheless extracted on silicon at different geometries and good simulation accuracy can be expected when the HVMOS channel is completely switched off and only the drain/bulk junction is forward-biased. But in other cases, the accuracy is limited, especially when the channel is in inversion and/or the bulk/substrate junction is forward-biased. Both conditions change the minority carrier distribution in the bulk/base a lot and lead to a change in the beta. There is no statistical process monitoring for these parasitic BJTs. In our experience the most reliable results and complete picture in simulation can be achieved with the substrate extractor tool, which is supported for xh018.
