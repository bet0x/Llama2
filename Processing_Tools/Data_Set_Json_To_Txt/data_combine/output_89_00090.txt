Can you tell me, Considering rules of W1DF and W2DF, what is the risk with narrow DIFF lines ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question by considering the rules of W1DF and W2DF and what is the risk with narrow DIFF lines is that one possible risk for narrow DIFF lines is problems with proper silicidation, which may result in different resistances than otherwise expected.
