Can you tell me, which DRC rules are classified as fatal ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding which DRC rules are classified as fatal is that  we do not publish a list of Fatal vs Critical errors as they are constantly under review and publication would imply that there are some errors that we don't mind the customer violating - that is not the case. We encourage customers to correct all errors - this will produce the best possible outcome on silicon. When there are special reasons that some errors cannot be fixed on layout, then we can discuss via the waiver system.  You can find fatal rule violations that  are available on sharepoint under "http://sp.erf.xfab.de/RandD/Projects_and_Reports/Lists/ProcessInformation/Category.aspx".
