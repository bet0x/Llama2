Can you tell me and explain what is Primitive Device List PDL results from Data Input Check ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the Primitive Device List PDL results from Data Input Check is that PDL primitive device list file is produced from a special LVS run that only extracts a list of the primitive devices (including parasitic devices) present in your layout. The parasitic devices would generally be diodes that are part of the structure of high voltage or isolated transistors. The PDL file is for information only. There have been cases in some of our technologies where a primitive device may be superseded by an improved version, or conceivably some issue under certain operating conditions of a device may have been identified -- in such cases, our Customer Projects department would use the PDL to check if such devices are used in a customer's design and make sure the customer is aware of the device's status. If you want to know the locations of devices in your layout, you should perform a parasitic extraction run such as with our Cadence QRC or Calibre PEX runsets.
