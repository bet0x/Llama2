Can you tell me, if it is okay if I exceed a transistor or device operating limit ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question if it is okay if you design exceed a transistor or device operating limit is that The breakdown voltage of a transistor is a kind of 'digital' description of the transistor strength. But the real life is manifold. Therefore reliability tests are performed to describe the transistor strength for the real world conditions. If the operating conditions are far away from the electrical limits there is no danger. But if the operating conditions get closer to the electrical limits the probability of malfunction or damage increases. Each MOS transistor consists of a parasitic bipolar transistor. This parasitic bipolar transistor makes the MOS transistor sensitive to pulses. The sensitivity depends on many factors. On the one hand on the pulse characteristics such as amplitude, length, duty cycle, rise and fall time, ripple, frequency and etc. On the other hand factors include the transistor layout such as size, construction, spacing to substrate contacts and others. There is an unlimited amount of possible scenarios. This is what it makes very difficult to judge whether special conditions can be allowed or not. Therefore only one general recommendation is to never exceed the specified operating limits.
