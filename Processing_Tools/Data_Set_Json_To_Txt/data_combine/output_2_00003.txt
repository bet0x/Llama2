Can you tell me, Is it possible for customer to upload their  of X-FAB data to the Cloud ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question, It is possible for customer to upload their  data or  X-FAB data to the Cloud, but only if written permission to do so is first received from X-FAB. To gain such written permission i would suggest you please contact Hotline who will ask you to
complete a questionnaire explaining the legal status of the hosting arrangement. The responses will be reviewed by X-FAB before a decision is given.
