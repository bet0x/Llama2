Can you tell me, Can you show me on how to run Calibre MIMANT from GUI within Virtuoso ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding on how to run Calibre MIMANT from GUI within Virtuoso is that there doesn't seem to be the easy selection to the MIMANT runset as is available with PVS. You could define $XFAB_CALIBRE_MIMANT_RUNSET and select xx018_xx51_MET5_METMID for the rules file, you have to navigate to the runset folder. I find it easier to copy xx018_xx51_MET5_METMID to my local Calibre DRC run directory, and edit the file by replacing $XFAB_CALIBRE_MIMANT_RUNSET with the explicit path "INCLUDE /design/xkit/xx018/mentor/v3_0/calibre_MIMANT/v3_0_1/018.rul.MIM.ANT"  and then specify that modified local xx018_xx51_MET5_METMID file as the rules file.
