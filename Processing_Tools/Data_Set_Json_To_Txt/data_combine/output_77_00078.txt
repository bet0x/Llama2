Can you tell me, by comparing the metal thicknesses of the bond pad stack to those of the Structural and Geometrical Parameters, why are the metal layers thinner on the bond pad ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question why metal layers is thinner on the bond pad is that the Structural and Geometrical Parameters show the metal layer thicknesses as deposited. However if you have large oxide windows as are there on the bond pad structures, then the pad metal is thinned (etched back), and this results in thinner metal layers directly on the bonding pads. Some process documents have the bond pad diagrams showing each metal layer with an ARC layer on top and below the metal. These ARC layers are relatively thin. The deposited thickness parameters include the ARC layers since they affect the stack thickness and hence all the parasitic capacitances. When the passivation window is opened onto the top metal, the final ARC layer is removed. Hence the bonding pad diagrams and associated note indicate a lesser thickness.
