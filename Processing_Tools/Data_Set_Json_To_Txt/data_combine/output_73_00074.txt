Can you tell me, Why simulations of transistor leakage produce inaccurate results that are independent of device widths ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question why simulations of transistor leakage produce inaccurate results that are independent of device widths is that this issue is related to the default gmin setting of the simulator, which is gmin=1e-12. This gives every node a conductivity of 1e-12 to aid convergence. That means basically it 'adds' at 1V a current of 1e-12A. Therefore this is not dependent on the transistor's width. To get correct results for such diode currents of small devices at T=27C you need to set gmin=1e-18. Please note that for some simulators like hspice, there are separate parameters: gmin and gmindc.
