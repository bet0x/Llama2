Can you tell me, Why rm1 metal resistor breakdown is much lower than that of higher level metal resistors ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding why  rm1 metal resistor breakdown is much lower than that of higher level metal resistors is that  this is related to the ILD/IMD voltage rating, for MET2 there is much thicker oxide than for MET1.  There is design rule S1M1DF, but this would require a DTI between the MET1 and DIFF geometry in question. If there are no active devices below rm1, the device could be placed over floating ISOTUB(s).
