Can you tell me, for wafers held at Poly, at what step are the wafers actually held or stop ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding at what step are the wafers actually held or stop especially for wafer held at poly is that for a request to hold at Poly, we will hold it at Active (ACT/DIFF) layer instead. For the 0.18um technologies, ACT and POLY1 dummies are required and both dummies are interlinked. Therefore, any POLY1 redesign may affect the ACT layer and may result in a new ACT mask. If the wafers that have been on hold at Poly had already processed with the old ACT mask, clearly the new ACT mask cannot be used for these wafers. So to avoid this from happening, we suggest to hold the wafers at the Active layer. However, if you can confirm that your future redesign will not change the ACT mask, we can support your request to hold the wafers at Poly.
