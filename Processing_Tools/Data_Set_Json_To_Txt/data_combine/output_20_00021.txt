Can you tell me, What is correct method to start DRC and LVS run ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the correct method to start DRC and LVS run, I advise you to not use .rul files directly, please use an appropriate header file which will set variables corresponding to your PDK setup options.
