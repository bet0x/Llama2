Can you tell me, how to  implement multiple instances of a ROM, each with different programming ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on how to implement multiple instances of a ROM each with different programming is that  when  you are instantiating multiple instances of the same ROM configuration but with different programmings, it is necessary to use the 'extended name' option on the front-end compiler so that each separate instance has a unique name. Otherwise, when IP replacement is performed, both instances will be identical. The distinct names will be used by the backend compiler so that the top cell name of the generated ROM block will be distinct. Otherwise the cal files submitted will be the same with identical top cell names. Then, even though your blackbox cell names are necessarily different, if we were to proceed with the IP replacement, the result would be all ROMs with the same programming. Thus to ensure each ROM instance will have the desired programming, generate the front-end data from the compiler using the extended name option to specify a unique name for each ROM.
