Can you tell me, if ELDO views for Cadence PDK is available ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question  if ELDO views for Cadence PDK is available is that Unfortunately we don't support ELDO views in our Cadence PDKs. An extra license is necessary to test such views in Cadence libraries, and we do not have that currently in X-FAB, so we cannot check and guarantee the correctness of such views. In principle it might be possible for a customer to use ELDO as a simulator within Cadence, although a hurdle may be the netlisting for the simulator, which may have some specific aspects different from the netlisting for Spectre or for HSpice. The conclusion is that X-FAB does not support ELDO simulation from Virtuoso within Cadence and that we don't have any instructions for those attempting to do so.
