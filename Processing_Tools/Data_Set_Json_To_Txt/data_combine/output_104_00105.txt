Can you tell me, Why do I get nwell, pwell width errors, violations flag, triggered for my pe5 devices? With relevant rules that include W1W1, W1W2, W1W3, W1W4, E1MVDF. Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question of why you get nwell, pwell width errors, violations flag, triggered for my pe5 devices because  Such errors should be corrected. NWELL drawn outside MV will be NWELL1, NWELL inside MV will be NWELL2. With NWELL crossing MV, the sliver outside MV is NWELL1. All NWELL associated with the pe5 must be enclosed by MV. For the pe5 devices, the MV layer extends 0.6um beyond the NWELL. This seemingly large MV enclosure of NWELL is due to the fact that the space between MV and the nwell will be PWELL2, for which rule W1W4 dictates a 0.6um minimum width.
