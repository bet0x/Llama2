Can you tell me, What is the handle wafer contact resistance ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question the resistance of handle wafer contact, is  that It is in the 10 kOhm range. We do not specify a value because it cannot be measured easily, e.g. from one HW contact to another the handle wafer resistance is in-between, from top to bottom is the thickness of the handle wafer and if not back-lapped the oxide on bottom also.  A similar issue exists for XT06; however a contact 'resistance' is specified in the Process Specifications, but indeed much of the resistance comes from handle wafer (undoped) resistance, not the contact itself.
