Can you tell me,on how to setup an internal my X-FAB (SiFo) account ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on how to setup an internal my X-FAB (SiFo) account  You may need to Follow the normal setup procedure (see http://sp.erf.xfab.de/RandD/DesSup/Hotline/AX_ACM-workflow-2020Mar.docx - or newer version if it exists). Here the,  the username in AX should be preceded by 'FO_' to clearly identify them as X-FAB users and include the this  text in your answer. "Thank you for your request. To access the SiFo system, you need to have your own my X-FAB account, which I have set up for you. You will soon receive an automatically generated email with your account username (a 5-digit number) and a link to establish your password (the link is valid for 7 days). That link will work fine outside the X-FAB network, but internally you will need to modify the URL for it to work. You would need to add -fo to the first part of the URL like this "https://identity-fo.xfab.com/...".
After establishing your password, to log into your account you will need to use this page for internal access "https://fo.xfab.com/" and whereas externally you would log in from this page https://my.xfab.com/
