Can you tell me, what is the procedure for an IO and ESD review by X-FAB ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the procedure for an IO and ESD review by X-FAB  is that the customer sends the layouts, schematics and all relevant descriptions such as normal pin operating voltages, max. ratings, required ESD robustness and etc to hotline@xfab.com. It is important for the review that when any type of analog IO cell (LV or HV) is used, also the circuitry that connects directly to the pad must be shown. We'll review the design data and provide first results via email. There can then be further review loops after design changes. There can then be also further online or face-to-face meetings for clarification - if required. A design review in an online meeting or face-to-face meeting is not appropriate. There is a higher risk that possible ESD design issues are overlooked when there is just a browsing through the design during an online meeting. Therefore an offline review is preferred.
