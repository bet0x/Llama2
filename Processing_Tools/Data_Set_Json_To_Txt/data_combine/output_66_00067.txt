Can you tell me, if the specified current density limits sufficient for metal width when considering ESD ? Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question if the specified current density limits is sufficient for metal width when considering ESD is that regarding the required metal width for ESD, usually the metal resistance is critical and not the current density/current capability of the metal. The current density for HBM ESD pulses is in the range of several hundred mA/um width for example 300-400mA/um). Only narrow metal lines would be damaged by ESD stress currents. The metal resistance is critical since voltage drops across power rails will add to the pad clamping voltage. Especially in the rail-based protection scheme the power rail resistance is critical. Concerning the power rail width, power rails should provide as rule of thumb a DC current capability of 50mA for 2kV HBM ESD robustness. A different metal resistance in the connections of multi-finger ESD protection devices can result in non-uniform current distribution and early failure of the ESD protection structure. Typical layout errors are e.g. largely different metal width in anode and cathode metal connections of diodes resulting in a current concentration in a small area of the diode or a largely different metal width between drain metal and source metal in ESD nmos snap-back devices resulting as well in non-uniform current distribution.
