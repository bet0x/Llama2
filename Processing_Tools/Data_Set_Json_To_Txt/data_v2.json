To answer your question regarding of diode forward bias operation in X-Fab,  In general we don't support forward biasing of diodes in our technologies unless specifically stated such as Schottky diodes. Mostly this is because the diode model parameters are chosen such that the reverse operation of the diode can be accurately simulated. This does not mean that the  simulation of the diodes in forward direction is totally wrong, but it can be less accurate. To model a diode in forward direction often requires parameters that are not available in the model or are insufficiently supported. You can simulate in forward direction and you will get a typical diode characteristic which is fairly accurate in the low current range but may be less accurate in the high current range (knee current, series resistance). In some of our documents is the statement that \"forward bias is not modeled\" which is based on this lack of accuracy in the models. The parameters describing the diode in forward bias are also very layout-specific, so an accurate model for a diode in forward bias would have to be related to a fixed layout.",

To answer your question regarding of diode forward bias operation in X-Fab,  In general we don't support forward biasing of diodes in our technologies unless specifically stated such as Schottky diodes. Mostly this is because the diode model parameters are chosen such that the reverse operation of the diode can be accurately simulated. This does not mean that the  simulation of the diodes in forward direction is totally wrong, but it can be less accurate. To model a diode in forward direction often requires parameters that are not available in the model or are insufficiently supported. You can simulate in forward direction and you will get a typical diode characteristic which is fairly accurate in the low current range but may be less accurate in the high current range (knee current, series resistance). In some of our documents is the statement that \"forward bias is not modeled\" which is based on this lack of accuracy in the models. The parameters describing the diode in forward bias are also very layout-specific, so an accurate model for a diode in forward bias would have to be related to a fixed layout.",

The distinct names will be used by the backend compiler so that the top cell name of the generated ROM block will be distinct. Otherwise the cal files submitted will be the same with identical top cell names. Then, even though your blackbox cell names are necessarily different, if we were to proceed with the IP replacement, the result would be all ROMs with the same programming. Thus to ensure each ROM instance will have the desired programming, generate the front-end data from the compiler using the extended name option to specify a unique name for each ROM.",

To answer your question regarding  the usage of Page 2 of Safety area, First, let  me clarify a couple of comments on the datasheet, if power supply interruption during store is impossible then the background is that the trim bits for the charge pump are stored in page 2. The trim bits are determined and stored during wafer probe 1. The trim bits control the programming and erase behavior (timing, pulses, programming and erase voltage level) of the Store operation. If the trim bits do not have the correct value, the endurance and data retention cannot be guaranteed. Any power supply interruption (for example brown-outs)\u00a0during Store operation could lead to corrupted non-volatile data, because the Store is not executed and finished correctly. Such scenarios are very application dependent. General recommendation is to store critical data like the trim bits on page 2 during wafer probe and final test and do no further Store operation to page 2 during the application. If the correct power supply and a correct Store can be guaranteed, storing to page 2 can also be done. Secondly, If no customer safety relevant data have to be stored it is sufficient to use the maximum size of page 1. In the compiler web interface on myXFAB, the page size (WORDS_PAGE1) can be customized (the restrictions are visible in the compiler web interface).

To answer your question concerning device operating limits and what is the meaning of  absolute'voltage limits, In general for X-FAB, the absolute voltage is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a device for a short period of time without significant damage.  The main reason we phrase it this way is because we can't be sure what the actual state of the device will be during this period of time. For example, if 7 volts is applied between the source and drain of a nmos4 device from the xc06 process 7V is the absolute max value for these terminals. We are not specifying what voltage is on the gate or body of the device.  If the gate and body were at 0V, this voltage could probably be held forever. But if the body was at 0V and the gate was at 2V, there would be significant hot carrier current to the gate and the device could fairly quickly degrade. Since this is a circuit issue, we have to use the conservative definition.

To answer your question regarding recommendations for corner lot splits is that the short answer is that unlike most digital-dominated fabs, we don't have a set menu of split conditions based on fast / typ / slow that customers should choose because in a mixed signal design there is often a lot more than just Vt and poly CD that can be critical to the design (but those parameters would normally be sufficient for a digital design). Therefore it's normal for a customer to make a specific request on what parameters it is desired to adjust and the relevant fab will review and confirm if that set of corners is possible. The negotiation would be done through Customer Projects at the relevant fab. Our digital libraries and memories are characterized in the process fast/slow 3 Sigma range. 3 Sigma production means that 99.73% of the delivered wafers are OK in terms of the stable process parameters. The process parameters are monitored with PCM test structures on each wafer. So, if your digital design is DRC, LVS clean and the timing analysis with post layout extraction is OK at the conditions as follow:\n\n1). PVT = wp(fast), VDD_max, Tj_min\n2). PVT = ws(slow), VDD_min, Tj_max\n\nthen you can expect 99.73% yield of the digital block in terms of process parameter deviations. The majority of our customers don't ask for corner lots for their projects, but some customers do it. The Vt and gate length adjustments implied by your proposed corners impact the relevant transistor parameters for digital timing which are saturation current and threshold voltage. The usual flow for ordering corner lots begins with the customer identifying the critical process parameters for their design (might not be simply 'digital' parameters) and submitting a list of required corners (must conform to the PCM pass/fail parameters) to X-FAB. The feasibility of such process variations will be checked by X-FAB (Customer Projects team) and then a final corner split proposal is sent.  The goal of such a corner should be to evaluate that the design would work at lower and upper spec limits. So the typical values are the upper and lower limits of the PCM Acceptance Specification (PAS). Here are some comments that have been collected from one of our FSEs. If you design according to the design rules, then the simulations should be sufficient. Some products require that the design rules be pushed to meet the performance requirements. In these cases, corner lots can identify process sensitivities where yield can be compromised. I would estimate that less than 10% of my customers are relying on Corner Lots for characterization, and these are generally only for high-volume products. When they do request they typically look at simple VTN/VTP, maybe HiRes Poly. The parameters are really design dependent. Even when I do get customers running corner lots, I'm not getting much feedback and request for product specific parametric targeting. This leads to my perception about the accuracy of the simulations. Potentially more effective than corner lots is coordinating a yield feedback loop once products are released to production. If we get your yield, bin, etc. information and input it into our yield enhancement software, we can correlate to equipment, inline, PCM, visual inspection, etc. Customers that work with us on this feedback will achieve yield stabilization much more quickly than without. We can work with you to review your Wafer/Final Test and coordinate the best means for yield feedback. One of our application engineers expanded on those comments, The customers that do request corner lots usually settle on +/-3 sigma for the parameters they are interested in. The LV MOS VT parameters are usually selected. Beyond that it really depends on the specifics of the process options the customer has chosen and the sensitivities their designers are most concerned with. However, there are some significant limitations on what parameters can be varied cleanly in a corner split. The LV MOS VT parameters are relatively straight forward because there is usually a separate VT adjust implant used on them that is separate from the well implant that controls breakdown and punch through, however there are usually a few interactions that cant be avoided (like output resistance and nw sheet resistance). The high sheet resistance poly resistors are generally easy to vary because there is usually a dedicated implant for that parameter. Beyond that things get more difficult. The HV transistor VT is sometimes split but there is almost always an interaction with transistor BVDSS, punch through, sometimes field threshold and often other parameters which can complicate evaluating the split. Other parameters are very difficult or expensive to split such as gate oxide thickness or capacitor values because they require dedicated diffusion or deposition runs that use the capacity of five or 6 lots for each split. My background is process development and I used to be a big fan of corner splits and ran a lot of them myself. I eventually concluded that they were not that useful for three reasons as follow:\n\n1). Too often there are parameter interactions that you cannot avoid which makes it difficult to impossible to get clean results from the splits.\n2).  You may plan for nominal, +3 sigma and -3 sigma splits but due to normal process variation you usually end up with each of these splits +/- 1 sigma or so from your intended target, e.g. -1 sigma, +2 sigma and -4 sigma, which again makes analysis difficult or impossible and may result in some splits being non-functional.\n\n* The corner splits are arranged by artificially varying one process parameter, such as the VT implant. In actual production lots each device parameter varies 'naturally' due to the interaction of several different process parameters. Each of these parameters has a different magnitude and direction impact on several different device parameters, usually for several different devices. As a result multiple device parameters tend to vary in a complex but related way. The corner split procedure does not reproduce this pattern so while you may get the target parameter to vary the way you want, the other device parameters will vary in a completely different way than you will see in actual production lots. For digital blocks this is probably not an important issue but for analog or RF blocks it may give a completely misleading result. I hope this input is helpful in your decision-making.",

To answer your question regarding why ESD module is not available for all MOS devices if it improves ESD robustness is that  this is usually in older technology nodes such as CX08, the ESD implant of the ESD module is added to aid with a vertical 'spike' issue that occurs under high current such as an ESD pulse when the aluminum which is slightly p-type in the contact can 'spike' through the n-junction and short it to the P-bulk below. The ESD n-type implant is deeper than the normal n-junction, preventing a short from occurring. The p-junction is not shorted out in the same circumstance, so ESD implant is not needed on p-devices.",

There can then be also further online or face-to-face meetings for clarification - if required. A design review in an online meeting or face-to-face meeting is not appropriate. There is a higher risk that possible ESD design issues are overlooked when there is just a browsing through the design during an online meeting. Therefore an offline review is preferred.",

To answer your question regarding the the differences, distinction between the types of body tied transistors is that there are two types of transistors available in the XI10 process, the H and A types. The A type transistors use the 'castellated' source/body structure; they have the advantage that they can be made whatever width the customer wants because the body contact is distributed along the source width. However, they have the disadvantage that the N+ and P+ diffusions for the source and body are touching, so there will be biasing limitations for these terminals. The xi10 S/D is not silicided, so at least there is no direct short between the source and body in these transistors, but with the N+/P+ abutment, trying to apply different voltages to the source and body will likely result in either high leakage between the two terminals or outright breakdown as this structure is effectively a surface Zener diode. The H type transistors place the body contacts of the transistors at the ends of the channel and separate the P+ and N+ diffusions by a cross connection of poly to the gate (the designation 'H' transistors comes from the resulting shape of the poly gate). The advantage of these devices is that with the diffusions separated no parasitic Zener diode is formed, so leakage and breakdown between the source and body will not be an issue. The disadvantage of these devices is that due to body resistance perpendicular to the channel, the ratio of W/L is limited for the devices to 6 for the nmos and 12 for the pmos devices.",

We came up with the peti and pe5ti devices specifically for this reason. These devices are standard pe or pe5 transistors but with HVNWELL used below the N-well which converts the entire tub to N-type.",

To answer your question regarding why  rm1 metal resistor breakdown is much lower than that of higher level metal resistors is that  this is related to the ILD/IMD voltage rating, for MET2 there is much thicker oxide than for MET1.  There is design rule S1M1DF, but this would require a DTI between the MET1 and DIFF geometry in question. If there are no active devices below rm1, the device could be placed over floating ISOTUB(s).",

To answer your question regarding after upgrading to version 12 PDK, why do rpp1 instances of existing design show different parameter values that  flag and trigger B7P1 design rule violations is that this is due to the underlying well options. The background here is that we found a bimodal distribution of rpp1 sheet resistance with NWELL below, depending on whether LP5MOS or MOS5 core module was used. To address this, we now offer two rpp1_3 resistor types: the rpp1_3 and a rpp1nw_3. The rpp1_3 has a new higher sheet resistance than before while the rpp1nw_3 has the same sheet resistance as the version 11 rpp1_3. This explains why, using rpp1_3, you get a different length for the same resistance in v12 PDK. You could use the new device rpp1nw_3 instead of rpp1_3 to get a better match to the old v11 and avoid the B7P1 error. Alternatively, you could leave your layout as-is and waive the B7P1 error as it is not fatal, but then if the design is re-used in a different core module later, you may see a different performance.",

To answer your question regarding at what step are the wafers actually held or stop especially for wafer held at poly is that for a request to hold at Poly, we will hold it at Active (ACT/DIFF) layer instead.
