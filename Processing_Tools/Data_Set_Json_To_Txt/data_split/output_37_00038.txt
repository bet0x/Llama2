Question: Can you tell me, does X-FAB offer or support Flip Chip support ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question if  X-FAB offer or support Flip Chip support is that  X-FAB did not support any additional processing for flip chip such as the seed and plating layers or the ball deposition so of course customers must discuss that with their assembly subcontractor. 
X-FAB does not offer any flip-chip specific processing. We don't make any special processing or bondpad designs for flip-chip either, but our standard pads have been used by some customers at flip-chip houses. Please review and understand your assembly partner's rules for flip-chip to check their requirements and see what if any modification might be needed to comply. You should be able to do any layout modifications yourself.
