Question: Can you tell me, my layout contain BOX elements and what are this ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding BOX elements and what are this issue with BOX elements has been described in the 'Guideline for GDSII data' document on my X-FAB: https://my.xfab.com/search/_action/relation/596e0b4e-74cd-47af-96ae-87dd43b1bdf5/
Unlike the boundary, the BOX element is not a filled figure. Therefore it cannot be used for IC geometry.
