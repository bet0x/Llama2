Question: Can you tell me, what is the purpose, intent and meaning of design rule B1PADM ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the  the purpose, intent and meaning of design rule B1PADM is that for B1PADM there are several reasons: one was to get similar heights of the pads. With different definition layers, different oxide stacks grow below the pad. For CMOSDEF e.g. there is a thinner oxide is grown, for DMOSDEF a thicker oxide is grown, without CMOSDEF and DMOSDEF an even thicker one is grown. DMOSDEF also forbids several design layers like POLY1 or DIFF in this area.
