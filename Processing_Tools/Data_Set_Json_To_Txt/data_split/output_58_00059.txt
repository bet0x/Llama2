Question: Can you tell me, what is the difference between protection diodes and other diodes?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the differences between protection diodes and other diodes is that  protection diode needs to carry a relatively high amount of current in breakdown to really protect the circuit, otherwise the voltage drop at the device to be protected can still be too high and do damage to it. Therefore it is measured at higher currents. Protection diodes are 'designed' to have a certain breakdown voltage which is defined rather by layout (overlap of wells, distances) not by doping profile. Note that usually it is more a concern about the contacts and wiring when looking at the current limits, rather than the diode parameters.
