Question: Can you tell me, how to setup customize PDK setup using .json file from SpecXplorer ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on how to setup customize PDK setup using .json file from SpecXplorer is that you can generate a .json file, after logging into the my X-FAB portal navigate to Design > SpecXplorer. Select your target process, then click either 'Select modules or 'Select modules by devices' (within your PDK setup, the first option will offer all devices in the selected module, second option will offer only the selected devices) and then choose the desired process modules. Click OK. Click the download icon next to the search box near the top right of the page. You can further refine the custom setup by unselecting primitive devices of the specified modules if for some reason you want to ensure they are not used. Lastly, click 'Export' to initiate download of the .json file. Use this file when starting your project by typing xkit -d <myfile.json>. This sets up a new project with your chosen modules / devices. Please refer to the xenv userguide for further information.
