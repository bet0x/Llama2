Question: Can you tell me, why ESD module is not available for all MOS devices if it improves ESD robustness ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding why ESD module is not available for all MOS devices if it improves ESD robustness is that  this is usually in older technology nodes such as CX08, the ESD implant of the ESD module is added to aid with a vertical 'spike' issue that occurs under high current such as an ESD pulse when the aluminum which is slightly p-type in the contact can 'spike' through the n-junction and short it to the P-bulk below. The ESD n-type implant is deeper than the normal n-junction, preventing a short from occurring. The p-junction is not shorted out in the same circumstance, so ESD implant is not needed on p-devices.
