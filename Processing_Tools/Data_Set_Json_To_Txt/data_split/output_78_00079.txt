Question: Can you tell me, what are D_CELLS DECAP cells for ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question of what is D_CELLS DECAP cells for is that these cells provide capacitors between vdd and gnd to reduce digital noise and IR drop. They are usually inserted during Place and Route after routing (where existing routing allows). In a second step, FEED* cells always have to be inserted to fill up the cell rows in places where no DECAP cells could be added. You may add (the larger, DECAP*15/DECAP*25) cells also before routing to have a certain amounnt of capacitors in the block, but these cells might have an influence on routability of the block. See Innovus commands addFiller, deleteFiller for details."
