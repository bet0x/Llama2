Question: Can you tell me, What is the maximum recommended temperature for wafer post processing ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the  maximum recommended temperature for wafer post processing  for post-processing is that usually we generally recommend that temperatures above 350C should be absolutely prevented. Higher temperatures can lead to metal-passivation or capacitor popping, IMD cracking, transistor shifts, metal voiding, enhanced Rpoly and especially RpolyH shifts depending on design, temperature ramp rate, duration and application atmosphere (N2, H2, etc.). If >350C cannot be avoided, we strongly recommend a DOE with the respective IC design using enhanced final test and also proper optical inspections after slightly accelerated post-processing stress for example slightly increased ramp rates, slightly longer storage times.
