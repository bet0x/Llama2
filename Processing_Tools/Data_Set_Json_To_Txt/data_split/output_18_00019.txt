Question: Can you tell me, What is diode forward bias operation in X-Fab ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding of diode forward bias operation in X-Fab,  In general we don't support forward biasing of diodes in our technologies unless specifically stated such as Schottky diodes. Mostly this is because the diode model parameters are chosen such that the reverse operation of the diode can be accurately simulated. This does not mean that the  simulation of the diodes in forward direction is totally wrong, but it can be less accurate. To model a diode in forward direction often requires parameters that are not available in the model or are insufficiently supported. You can simulate in forward direction and you will get a typical diode characteristic which is fairly accurate in the low current range but may be less accurate in the high current range (knee current, series resistance). In some of our documents is the statement that "forward bias is not modeled" which is based on this lack of accuracy in the models. The parameters describing the diode in forward bias are also very layout-specific, so an accurate model for a diode in forward bias would have to be related to a fixed layout.
