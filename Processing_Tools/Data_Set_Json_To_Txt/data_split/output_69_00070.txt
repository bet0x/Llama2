Question: Can you tell me, How can I use  various GATES logic libraries?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on how you can use  various GATES logic libraries is that the GATES  libraries are schematic and parameters only libraries which are used as referenced 'building block' gates libraries inside the D_CELLS  libraries. They support only the schematic side of the respective D_CELLS* libraries the rev_info.txt file of a given D_CELLS library will specify which GATES* library it requires. Therefore the GATES libraries cannot and must not be used as a stand-alone library.
