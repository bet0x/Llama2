Question: Can you tell me, Assura tool gives background stamp errors and What exactly are these meaning ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the Assura tool gives you background stamp errors and meaning behind this errors is that The bkgnd_StampErrorFloat error simply means that the layout being checked has no connection to the substrate. Placing even just a single PDIFF contact will clear the error of course such would not be sufficient for an entire chip. The bkgnd_StampErrorMult and bkgnd_StampErrorConnect errors work together to indicate that the layout has multiple substrate connections that are not connected to the same node with metal which resulting in soft connections through the substrate. Assura will flag one of the connections stamps with bkgnd_StampErrorMult and all of the others with bkgnd_StampErrorConnect.
