Question: Can you tell me, what is radiation Hardness ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding radiation Hardness is that  X-FAB has not characterized any of its processes for radiation-hardness and we do not monitor or warrant any of our technologies for radiation hardness, nor do we have expertise in the design of radiation hardened cells. We do have customers who do their own designs for radiation hard applications that using both CMOS bulk wafer and SOI technologies , but those customers use either their own experience or public information about the best techniques to use, and then assess the results themselves. SOI processes are generally more radiation tolerant than bulk CMOS processes  but we cannot say by how much in our technologies. Clearly we're not at liberty to discuss any techniques that another customer has used, so we can only refer customers to whatever can be found in the public literature to aid their design. Note that some design techniques could involve the use of structures or layouts that are not supported by our verification decks. For DRC errors on them, we could only advise on the manufacturability of the structure, but the responsibility of waiving them would be the customer's. Any LVS or extraction issues arising from special structures not corresponding to our characterized primitive devices would also not be supported.
