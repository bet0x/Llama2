Question: Can you tell me, concerning device operating limits, what do is the meaning of  absolute'voltage limits and what it is specify ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question concerning device operating limits and what is the meaning of  absolute'voltage limits, In general for X-FAB, the absolute voltage is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a device for a short period of time without significant damage.  The main reason we phrase it this way is because we can't be sure what the actual state of the device will be during this period of time. For example, if 7 volts is applied between the source and drain of a nmos4 device from the xc06 process 7V is the absolute max value for these terminals. We are not specifying what voltage is on the gate or body of the device.  If the gate and body were at 0V, this voltage could probably be held forever. But if the body was at 0V and the gate was at 2V, there would be significant hot carrier current to the gate and the device could fairly quickly degrade. Since this is a circuit issue, we have to use the conservative definition. If in your designs you can guarantee that the devices are always off when the maximum voltage is applied, the devices will probably survive indefinitely. However, please remember that X-FAB will not guarantee this.
