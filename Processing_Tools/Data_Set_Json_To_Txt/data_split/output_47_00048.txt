Question: Can you tell me, how are the PDK bindkeys for Cadence is defined or setup ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question on how you can bind, defined and setup the PDK bindkeys for Cadence is that you should find a file .xfabcadrc created in your $HOME directory when you first execute the xkit script. For example by set XfabCadNoSetBindKey = t, means suppress default bindkey settings.
However since this is commented out by default, the default Cadence bindkeys are used, which may be located in $CDSHOME/tools/dfII/samples/local. You can define your own customized bindkeys in your .cdsinit_personal file.
