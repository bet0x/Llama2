Question: Can you tell me, The SPICE model libraries include *_bjt models for some MOS devices and what are they for ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the SPICE model libraries that include *_bjt models for some MOS devices and what it is for, In short the purpose of the added PNP bipolars to the *_bjt models is to show that there can occur bipolar effects under certain conditions, but it is by far not very accurate and it has limitations. It is nevertheless extracted on silicon at different geometries and good simulation accuracy can be expected when the HVMOS channel is completely switched off and only the drain/bulk junction is forward-biased. But in other cases, the accuracy is limited, especially when the channel is in inversion and/or the bulk/substrate junction is forward-biased. Both conditions change the minority carrier distribution in the bulk/base a lot and lead to a change in the beta. There is no statistical process monitoring for these parasitic BJTs. In our experience the most reliable results and complete picture in simulation can be achieved with the substrate extractor tool, which is supported for xh018.
