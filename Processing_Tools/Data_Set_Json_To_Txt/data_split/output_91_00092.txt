Question: Can you tell me, if  X-Fab perform metal fill for xb06 or X*06 process or technologies ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question  if  X-Fab perform metal fill for xb06 or X*06 process or technologies is that although the xb06 Peripheral Ring diagram available on my X-FAB shows the NOFILLM layer, we do not normally perform metal fill for XB06. However the rules are in place, and we have done it as a special case when requested by a customer. So unless it is requested, there is no need to include the NOFILLM layer. The xb06 Cadence PDK has the layer defined: it's specified in the stream layer table, but the layer palette has the layer set as invalid, so a user would have to change it to valid to be able to draw with it.
