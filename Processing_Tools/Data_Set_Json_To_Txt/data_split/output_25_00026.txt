Question: Can you tell me, what is the differences between IO_CELLS and HV_CELLS libraries ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the differences between IO_CELLS and HV_CELLS libraries  are For 5V application or LV application, it is normally sufficient to use IO_CELLS*. HV_CELLS are mainly used when none of the IO_CELLS* fit your requirement, such as needing to implement HV ESD protection. Some general remarks on the differences between HV_CELLS and IO_CELLS are that IO library pad cells are provided as pad-limited or core-limited layouts, support of multiple power rails. They are also complete IO pad cells with input  output buffer circuitry, also HV pad cells are provided as block,layouts, and normally HV ESD protection structures are too big to fit into a LV IO pad cell frame, moreover HV pad cells consist of protection block and bond pad, and usually contain no power rails or HV input output buffer circuitry and lastly the protection block can be combined with different size bond pads, and it is intended as a starting point for custom HV ESD pad cell designs.
