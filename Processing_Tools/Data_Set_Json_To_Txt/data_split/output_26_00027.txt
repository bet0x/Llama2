Question: Can you tell me, Why there is no MIM capacitor antenna DRC checks in XH035  also in other X*035 technology ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding why there is no MIM capacitor antenna DRC checks in XH035  also in other X*035 technology is that for single MIM option on X035, we believe there is no issue with plasma damage. For DMIM construction on X035 which resembles the case of two individual single MIMs - no cross coupling routing, we also believe that it has low impact. So far, we have not seen any big issue with the 0.35um process due to plasma induce damage (PID) from designs point of view with all existing working customers product. Therefore you see in general the guideline is it considered as a recommendation only.
