Question: Can you tell me, where I can find Qualification Certificate location ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding on where you can find Qualification Certificate location is that for older node technology certificates such as XC06 are not on my X-FAB, but newer ones can be found at "https://my.xfab.com/search/qualityreliability/documents?_XTICSSPDocumentTypes=OQpHlF2bTNqMnV6YDaFKoA". Meanhile for XC06/XB06/CX06 qualification certificates which you can find at "http://sp.erf.xfab.de/RandD/Projects_and_Reports/Certificate/Forms/ProcessOverview.aspx#InplviewHash406e8429-4700-43c4-b969-8f88d204f697=FilterField1%3DProzess%255Fx0020%255FFamily-FilterValue1%3DXC06". Please Pay attention to the fab at Location column and modules at Status overview column.
