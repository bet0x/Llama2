Question: Can you tell me, Why X-Fab pattern fill did not resolve, fix or clear  R1DF minimum DIFF density design rule violations or errors?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding  why X-Fab pattern fill did not resolve, fix or clear  R1DF minimum DIFF density design rule violations or errors because As flatly stated in the 'Dummy Pattern Generation' section of the Design Rule Specification, 'The dummy pattern generation script does not guarantee that the minimum and maximum structure densities of the related layer are met.' The document further recommends 'to use X-FAB's dummy pattern generation option (DUMMY_FILL included in the DRC for preview) to create dummy pattern. If the generated dummy pattern is not sufficient to meet the minimum requirements for pattern density, customers can draw additional dummy pattern following the dummy design rules...' -- the referenced R1DF application note may be helpful (especially for the case of poly resistor arrays), or other situations might be solved by placing larger DIFF dummy structures. The *.rdb files from DRC will indicate the pattern density of flagged windows (R1DF is checked in 200um square windows stepped by 100um), which is given by the 'DV' parameter (multiply it by 100 for percentage).
