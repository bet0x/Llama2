Question: Can you tell me, Is there any correlation between the deviation of the sheet resistance (RS) of resistors and that of their thermal coefficients TC1 and TC2 ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding  correlation between the deviation of the sheet resistance (RS) of resistors and that of their thermal coefficients TC1 and TC2. For this,  In case of some resistors, there seems to be some correlation between the sheet resistance and their temperature coefficients TC1 and TC2. In some other cases the correlation seems to be quite weak. For your informatin rzp2 ,TC1 tends to the high corner for low RS and vice versa and TC2 tends to the high corner for low TC1 and vice versa. For rnp1, TC1 tends to the high corner for lower RS and vice versa and TC2 tends to the high corner for low TC1 and vice versa. For rw, TC1 tends to the low corner for lower RS and vice versa and TC2 tends to the high corner for low TC1 and vice versa. For rpp1,TC1 tends to the high corner for lower RS and vice versa and TC2 tends to the high corner for low TC1 and vice versa.
