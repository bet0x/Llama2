Question: Can you tell me, What is the surface roughness with FLATPV vs SFLATPV modules ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding  the surface roughness of FLATPV versus SFLATPV modules is that toughness of standard passivation is not specified and therefore not a parameter which the customer should rely on. If surface roughness is critical, customer should specify either the FLATPV module known as Flat Passivation module for which the surface roughness is expected to be ~2.13nm Ra or SFLATPV known as Sensor Flat Passivation for which the surface roughness is expected to be ~0.18nm Ra. Please note that these are sample values and are not guaranteed. Note that these additional modules affect the final passivation thickness. You can see parameters THV_FLAT & THV_SFLAT.
