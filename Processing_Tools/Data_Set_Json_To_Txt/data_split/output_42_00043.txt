Question: Can you tell me, what is the meaning of the Assura 'minority PTUB connectors' error message ?
Answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with it. To answer your question regarding the meaning of the Assura 'minority PTUB connectors' error message is that It is generated by the connect statement from Assura. It means that more than one net is connected to the layer. The stamped layer receives the net information from the net with the most contacts. All other nets are marked with this error. For more detailed information please refer to the Assura manuals. X-FAB does not document tool specific messages. The Assura Command Reference manual (a document primarily aimed at runset developers) explains that: 'A layer with a soft connection is a layer that only receives connectivity information and does not pass on that connectivity information. You can use the soft keyword to check layers for high-resistivity, such as wells, where you want them to be part of the net, but you do not want them to be used as a connection between two conducting layers. This means PTUB_soft_connect errors are 'soft connection' shorts through a common layer, which is often the PSUB, or a common well. In other words, multiple distinct nets are connected to that common layer. Perhaps those distinct nets were not intended to be distinct and should be connected together by metal. It also should be inferred that it is not an error that you'll find defined in an X-FAB Design Rule Specification. For a technology such as XT018, it could result from neglecting to put a trench around a p-type tub to isolate it from other tubs.
