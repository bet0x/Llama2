Question: Do the I/O libraries support copper wire bonding?
Answer: We do not have any I/O libraries specifically designed for Cu bonding. Some customers have reported running into problems with copper wire bonding but in at least some cases, different customers have used exactly the same pad structure and one had no problem while the other had issues. This indicates different assembly houses can have quite different bonding parameters, and as copper wire bonding is a harsher process than gold or aluminum bonding, marginalities in the interaction between the process and bonding are more likely to show up. One suggestion is to consider using the thick metal (METTHK) module to give the widest bonding margin for assembly - and don't use in conjunction with circuit-under-pad techniques. If thick metal is not or cannot be used, inform your assembly partner of the top metal thickness.
