Question: What is the difference between the types of body tied transistors?
Answer: There are two types of transistors available in the XI10 process, the H and A types.
The A type transistors use the 'castellated' source/body structure; they have the advantage that they can be made whatever width the customer wants because the body contact is distributed along the source width. However, they have the disadvantage that the N+ and P+ diffusions for the source and body are touching, so there will be biasing limitations for these terminals. The xi10 S/D is not silicided, so at least there is no direct short between the source and body in these transistors, but with the N+/P+ abutment, trying to apply different voltages to the source and body will likely result in either high leakage between the two terminals or outright breakdown as this structure is effectively a surface Zener diode.
The H type transistors place the body contacts of the transistors at the ends of the channel and separate the P+ and N+ diffusions by a cross connection of poly to the gate (the designation 'H' transistors comes from the resulting shape of the poly gate). The advantage of these devices is that with the diffusions separated no parasitic Zener diode is formed, so leakage and breakdown between the source and body will not be an issue. The disadvantage of these devices is that due to body resistance perpendicular to the channel, the ratio of W/L is limited for the devices to 6 for the nmos and 12 for the pmos devices.
