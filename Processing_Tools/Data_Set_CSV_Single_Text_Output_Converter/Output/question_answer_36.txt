Question: Does X-FAB offer Flip Chip support?
Answer: X-FAB does not support any additional processing for flip chip (such as the seed and plating layers or the ball deposition) so of course customers must discuss that with their assembly subcontractor.
X-FAB does not offer any flip-chip specific processing. We don't make any special processing or bondpad designs for flip-chip either, but our standard pads have been used by some customers at flip-chip houses. Please review and understand your assembly partner's rules for flip-chip to check their requirements and see what (if any) modification might be needed to comply. You should be able to do any layout modifications yourself.
