Question: Why doesn't the xt018 HV_CELLS library automatically load?
Answer: The module requirements can differ depending on the selected cell -- this applies mainly to the 1.8V cells as they are not compatible with the MOS5 core module. In the Cadence PDK environment, whether an X-FAB library is available for a particular PDK startup option is controlled by the pdk_code.txt file within the library. The file currently in the library only specifies options with the LP5MOS main module. However, the library can also be used with the MOS5 main module (except the 1.8V cells, as already noted).
The pdk_code.txt file can be amended as below to include MOS5, which specifies the compatible options. Change the file in your installed library at (the exact path depends on the library version) $X_DIR/xt018/esdlibs/HV_CELLS/v1_2/cadence_IC61/v1_2_0/HV_CELLS/ with the content below.
It's important that when selecting any cell, you ensure that its module requirements are consistent with those of your design.

# Do not edit this file!
# File keeps xkit start up information
