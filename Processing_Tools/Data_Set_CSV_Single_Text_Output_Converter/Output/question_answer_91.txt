Question: The NVRAM datasheet indicates 1.8V and 3.3V supplies are required. Are they both needed for normal operation, or just for programming?
Answer: STORE / RECALL operations require 1.8V and 3.3V; READ / WRITE of the SRAM requires only 1.8V.
The 3.3V is only necessary (in addition to 1.8V) during STORE (the programming of the non-volatile part) and during RECALL (the cycle for bring back the information to the SRAM). For read / write of the SRAM only the 1.8V supply is needed.
