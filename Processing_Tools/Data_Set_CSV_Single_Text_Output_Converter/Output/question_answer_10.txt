Question: Run Calibre MIMANT from GUI within Virtuoso
Answer: There doesn't seem to be the easy selection to the MIMANT runset as is available with PVS.
You could define $XFAB_CALIBRE_MIMANT_RUNSET and select xx018_xx51_MET5_METMID for the rules file (you have to navigate to the runset folder). I find it easier to copy xx018_xx51_MET5_METMID to my local Calibre DRC run directory, and edit the file replacing $XFAB_CALIBRE_MIMANT_RUNSET with the explicit path:
INCLUDE /design/xkit/xx018/mentor/v3_0/calibre_MIMANT/v3_0_1/018.rul.MIM.ANT
Then specify that modified local xx018_xx51_MET5_METMID file as the rules file.
