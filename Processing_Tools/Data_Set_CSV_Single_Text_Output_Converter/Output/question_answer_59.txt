Question: Should I include pattern in my design, or will X-FAB perform the pattern fill?
Answer: For technologies that specify density limits and include one or more blocking layers for the fill, the fab will perform it. The DRC runsets for our 180nm technologies can generate 'virtual' dummies that are taken into account during DRC. It is also possible to have the runset export the dummies to GDS such that you could merge it with your design. The problem with the dummy generation is that all structures are flat, which results in larger GDS files. Therefore it is recommended to let our Mask Tooling group do the pattern fill.
For capacitively critical structures, relevant metal layers only should be blocked rather than using the BLKALL layer.
The parasitic extraction runsets can C-extract these structures for determining their impact on the performance.
The fill routines observe spacing margin and dummy size rules -- one consequence of that is the fill routine is not guaranteed to satisfy the minimum density rules. When that's the case, you may need to apply some extra effort, such as manually drawing a denser fill pattern.
