Question: Please clarify the use of the HRPOLY and LRPOLY modules.
Answer: The primitive devices in the HRPOLY module are already included in the MOSLL or MOSLT main modules flow. Similarly, the primitives in the LRPOLY module are already included in the MOS or MOS5 main modules.

The resistors rpp1 and rnp1 have the HRES as a design layer. This layer is included on the primitive device in the PRIMLIB.
For MOS/MOS5 process flows, the HRES design layer is used to generate the UGM mask.
For the MOSLL/MOSLT flows the HRES design layer is not used.

The resistors rp1 and rsp1 have the LRES as a design layer. This layer is included on the primitive device in the PRIMLIB.
For MOSLL/MOSLT flows, the LRES design layer is used to generate the NGM mask.
For the MOS/MOS5 flows the LRES design layer is not used.

The Design Rule Specification includes these comments in the design layer table:

LRES Required for device recognition.
Also used for mask generation when MOSLL or MOSLT modules are selected.

LRES under MOS flow IS USED for mask generation with the XRPOLY module.
See the dpol device rules.

HRES Required for device recognition.
Also used for mask generation when MOS or MOS5 modules are selected.

Please leave the HRES design layer on the resistors.
