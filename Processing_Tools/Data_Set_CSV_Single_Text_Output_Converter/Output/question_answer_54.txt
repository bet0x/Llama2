Question: Why are the breakdown voltage parameters generally significantly different from the operating limits?
Answer: The device electrical parameters are those measured either at PCM (on every wafer manufactured) or during a characterization phase of the development. The min/max values being defined by the measured results and then engineering experience to set the min/max limits. For breakdown voltage, these values are when the device fails at the time of measurement. In contast the Operating Conditions are defined to ensure that the device will survive for 10 years. The accelerated life test has been/will be performed at these ratings (depending upon status of process, conditional or released)."
