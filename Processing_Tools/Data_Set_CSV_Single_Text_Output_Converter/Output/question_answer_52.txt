Question: What exactly does the ESD module do and why is it not available for all MOS devices if it improves ESD robustness?
Answer: Usually in older technology nodes such as CX08, the ESD implant of the ESD module is added to aid with a vertical 'spike' issue that occurs under high current (such as an ESD pulse) when the aluminum (which is slightly p-type) in the contact can 'spike' through the n-junction and short it to the P-bulk below. The ESD (n-type) implant is deeper than the normal n-junction, preventing a short from occurring. The p-junction is not shorted out in the same circumstance, so ESD implant is not needed on p-devices.
