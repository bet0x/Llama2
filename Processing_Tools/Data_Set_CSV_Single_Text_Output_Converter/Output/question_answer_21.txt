Question: A new PDK version has been released, do I need to update (design is already in progress)?
Answer: For new designs, we recommend customers always use the latest PDK. For designs in progress when an update is released, customers can review the revision notes (both the changes document for the process specifications, and the notes in theÂ rev_info.txt files for each EDA package) to evaluate if the changes are critical to their design. In principle, we could have rare special cases where we wouldn't accept designs based on an older PDK. Bear in mind that at tape-in, our mask tooling team always uses the most recent runset for DRC, so customers might want to check their designs with the latest runset to avoid possible surprises.
