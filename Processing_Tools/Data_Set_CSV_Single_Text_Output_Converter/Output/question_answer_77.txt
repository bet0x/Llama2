Question: What is the basis for Schottky diode forward bias limit?
Answer: It is important not to exceed the Vanode-Vcathode operating limit for the forward direction current. This would tend to exceed the allowable thermal load of the diode. Select an appropriate size for the intended current and to be safe, apply some margin with respect to the size.
