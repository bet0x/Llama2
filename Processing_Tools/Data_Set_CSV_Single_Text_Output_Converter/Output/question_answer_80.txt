Question: What films are on the wafer backside?
Answer: As example from a particular technology flow, backside films include a stack of oxide, nitride, TEOS, SION, nitride (the most outer layer). There may be some differences depending on technology and module options.
During manufacture, the backside is not necessarily protected from what is grown or deposited on the front side (this would be the case, for example, when wafers are loaded for batch processing into a tool in a quartz boat), so there is some accumulation of films on the backside. For many applications, wafers would undergo a backgrind operation to thin total wafer thickness, which also removes such films.
