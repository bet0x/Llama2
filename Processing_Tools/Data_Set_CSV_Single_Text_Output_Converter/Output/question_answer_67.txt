Question: My layout was flagged for containing BOX elements. What are they and why are they not accepted?
Answer: The issue with BOX elements is described in the 'Guideline for GDSII data' document on my X-FAB: https://my.xfab.com/search/_action/relation/596e0b4e-74cd-47af-96ae-87dd43b1bdf5/
Unlike the boundary, the BOX element is not a filled figure. Therefore it cannot be used for IC geometry.
