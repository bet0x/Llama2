Question: What is the surface roughness with FLATPV vs SFLATPV modules?
Answer: Roughness of standard passivation is not specified, and therefore not a parameter which the customer should rely on. If surface roughness is critical, customer should specify either the FLATPV module (for which the surface roughness is expected to be ~2.13nm Ra) or SFLATPV (for which the surface roughness is expected to be ~0.18nm Ra) - note that these are sample values and are not guaranteed. Note that these additional modules affect the final passivation thickness - see parameters THV_FLAT & THV_SFLAT.
