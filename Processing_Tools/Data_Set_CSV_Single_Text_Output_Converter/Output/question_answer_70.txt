Question: What is the maximum recommended temperature for wafer post processing?
Answer: For post-processing, we generally recommend that temperatures above 350C should be absolutely prevented. Higher temperatures can lead to metal-passivation or capacitor popping, IMD cracking, transistor shifts, metal voiding, enhanced Rpoly and especially RpolyH shifts depending on design, temperature ramp rate, duration and application atmosphere (N2, H2, etc.). If >350C cannot be avoided, we strongly recommend a DOE with the respective IC design using enhanced final test and also proper optical inspections after slightly accelerated post-processing stress (e.g. slightly increased ramp rates, slightly longer storage times).
