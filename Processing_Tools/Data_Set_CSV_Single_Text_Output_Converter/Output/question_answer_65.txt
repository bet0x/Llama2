Question: How do I use the various GATES* logic libraries?
Answer: The GATES* libraries are schematic & parameters only libraries which are used as referenced 'building block' gates libraries inside the D_CELLS* libraries. They support only the schematic side of the respective D_CELLS* libraries (the *rev_info.txt file of a given D_CELLS* library will specify which GATES* library it requires). Therefore the GATES* libraries cannot and must not be used as a stand-alone library."
