Question: How can I generate the PDL.txt file that is included with my DRC results from the fab?
Answer: The primitive device list is generated using PVS LVS. The command line option requires setting parameters in a header file. Using the PVS LVS GUI may be easier for most users to extract a list of the primitive devices used in a given layout.

1. Open layout (read-only is OK)
2. PVS -> Run LVS
3. Input -> exclude comparison setup
4. Output -> LVS Report -> Click 'SET' button.
5. Apply/Submit to initiate the run.

Results:
Files/Output Files: Extraction report -> scroll to bottom of report.
Or in the Extraction tab, Uncheck 'hide statistic' then click on flat device count.
Or you can just open the <cell name>_lvs.sum file from the run directory. The list is at the end of the file.
