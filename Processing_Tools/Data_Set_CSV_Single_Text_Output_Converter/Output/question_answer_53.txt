Question: How do I display DC operating parameters that I expect but are not shown on the schematic?
Answer: Some DC operating parameters that are available in the Results Browser may not be displayable in the schematic. You might try adding all the required parameters to the ADE L Outputs window. This would help you to view your results after your run instead of looking into the Results Browser every time. This can be done as follows.
1) Run your DC simulation.
2) Goto ADE L → Tools → Results Browser
3) Double click on dcOpInfo and choose the required transistor; there you can find all the parameters.
4) Right click on the required parameter and then click on Calculator.
5) You can either copy this expression and add to your ADE L Outputs or you can just click on Send Buffer expression to ADE Outputs and this will send your calculator expression to your ADE L Outputs. You can also name your expression.

Consider the operating point tables out of Cadence with caution. The CDF parameters Cadence produces are not always conformant with a SPICE simulation or even certain model card parameters. For example, often Cadence does not take into account all capacitances from a model, especially if it is a macro model. Or in other words, it is not quite clear if the capacitance calculated is the actual capacitance resulting from a SPICE simulation.
