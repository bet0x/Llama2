Question: Customer upload of X-FAB data to the Cloud
Answer: This is possible, but only if written permission to do so is first received from X-FAB. To gain such written permission, please contact Hotline who will ask you to complete a questionnaire explaining the legal status of the hosting arrangement. The responses will be reviewed by X-FAB before a decision is given.
