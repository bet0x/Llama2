Question: What is the PDL.txt file included with my results from the fab's DRC run?
Answer: The PDL (primitive device list) file is the result of a special LVS run that only extracts the primitive devices (including parasitic devices) present in your layout. The parasitic devices included (p_*) would generally be diodes that are part of the structure of high voltage or isolated transistors.

The PDL file is for information only. There have been cases in some of our technologies where a primitive device may be superseded by an improved version, or conceivably some issue under certain operating conditions of a device may have been identified -- in such cases, our Customer Projects department would use the PDL to check if such devices are used in a customer's design and make sure the customer is aware of the device's status.
