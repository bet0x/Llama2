Question: Is it okay if I exceed a transistor's operating limit by such-and-such amount?
Answer: The BV of a transistor is a kind of 'digital' description of the transistor strength. But the real life is manifold. Therefore reliability tests are performed to describe the transistor strength for the real world conditions. If the operating conditions are far away from the electrical limits there is no danger. But if the operating conditions get closer to the electrical limits the probability of malfunction or damage increases.
Each MOS transistor consists of a parasitic bipolar transistor. This parasitic bipolar transistor makes the MOS transistor sensitive to pulses. The sensitivity depends on many factors. On the one hand on the pulse characteristics (amplitude, length, duty cycle, rise and fall time, ripple, frequency, etc.). On the other hand factors include the transistor layout (size, construction, spacing to substrate contacts, etc.). There is an unlimited amount of possible scenarios. This is what it makes very difficult to judge whether special conditions can be allowed or not. Therefore only one general recommendation: never exceed the specified operating limits.
