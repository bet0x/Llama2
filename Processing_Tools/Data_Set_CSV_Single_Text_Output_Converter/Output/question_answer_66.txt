Question: What is the GATES_PCELL library that is available for several technologies?
Answer: The library is classified as an analog library for the purpose of my X-FAB organization:
under Design > EDA Files, filter to Libraries > Analog > GATES_PCELL.
However, unlike our other analog libraries, these GATES_PCELL libraries are freely available to customers -- there is no license requirement or fee.
Within the library is a userguide document. As the library name inplies, it provides parameterized cells for some types of gates (some basic logic functions, transmission gates, and other related special purpose cells).

The introduction in the userguide states: 'The intention of this library is to provide a cell library for analogue components. This includes layout, schematics and verilog. It is not the intention to use the components in a digital design flow. You must use characterised cells instead.'
