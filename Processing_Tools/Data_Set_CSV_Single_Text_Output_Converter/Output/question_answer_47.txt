Question: The qpa device causes issues during LVS. How to resolve it?
Answer: For a hierarchical run, the Calibre LVS layout-extracted netlist creates an internal subcircuit for qpa which is the source of the error, for example:
.SUBCKT qpa 1 2 3 5
** N=8 EP=4 IP=0 FDC=1
X0 3 5 2 1 QPA $X=2600 $Y=2600 $D=20
.ENDS

As we cannot interfere with Calibre's internal hierarchy processing engine, the workaround is to explicitly flatten the cell by including this command in calibre GUI LVS Options/Include tab:
FLATTEN CELL qpa
