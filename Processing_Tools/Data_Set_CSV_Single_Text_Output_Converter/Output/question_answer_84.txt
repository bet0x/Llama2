Question: When we try to fix rule W5M1 {Minimum MET1 width joining wide MET1 track (>35 æ­©} errors, we sometimes get inexplicable errors.
Answer: This rule is marked in red in the specification, which means it cannot be 100% reliably checked by verification decks. The rule requires sizing operations on layers that can produce artifacts on non-orthogonal shapes. That's why the rule is unselected by default in the runset. It can be activated and it provides some assistance but it is the user's final responsibility to check manually. This is also why we don't check the rule at tape in.
