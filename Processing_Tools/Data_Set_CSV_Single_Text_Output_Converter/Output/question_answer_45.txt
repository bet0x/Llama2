Question: Is backgrinding available for xs018?
Answer: Backgrinding is not supported for xs018. This is due to the risk on optical applications (both logistical handling and the potential defect). If it is a single exception (example MPW) or non-optical application, you can try to align with our Customer Projects department to check if X-FAB can offer backgrinding.
