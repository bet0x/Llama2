Question: Can I export from Innovus to GDS without having to use Virtuoso to replace abstract views with the layout views?
Answer: One can directly write out from Innovus to an OA library that has replaced abstract views with layout views:
oaOut ${newlibName} ${designName} ${cellName} -autoRemaster -leafViewNames { layout }

The output library should be different from the Innovus working OA library, as the new library cannot be read back into Innovus because all timing views and global settings will have been lost.

Our 180nm technology Cadence PDK kernels include support for GDS export from Innovus. The mapping files to be used when streaming Innovus layers to GDS are in the technology library corresponding to your PDK setup code, for example:
$X_DIR/xh018/cadence/v*_*/PDK/IC61/v*_*_*/TECH_XH018_1141/pnr_streamout.map

Additionally, the PVS QRC runset provides mapping files to be used when running QRC extraction from Innovus, for example:
$X_DIR/xh018/cadence/v*_*/QRC_pvs/v*_*_*/XH018_1141/QRC-Typ/xx018_lef_qrc.map
(file exists also in the QRC-Min and QRC-Max folders).
