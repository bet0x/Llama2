Question: How should the poly ring of diodes be biased?
Answer: Due to its lateral construction, the diode is different from pure bulk junction diodes in other processes.
You might review the Device Characteristics Documentation (you can either download the package or browse online by clicking the globe icon) to see how the poly ring potential influences the current.

The 'dn' model is a subckt model consisting of level1 diode models with different ideality factors. In this model the different diodes are used to model the current forward/reverse over temperature. With respect to the diode current the process variation is solely covered by changing the 'is' parameter in the model and the ideality factor is unchanged. Usually the diode current consists of an ideal and a non-ideal part and the ratio of both can change with process variation (the non-ideal part is fluctuating, while the ideal part is very stable). Changing the ideality factor in the model would lead to a large deviation of the current over temperature, which we do not observe, but we only have limited data from a statistical point of view (only lab measurements over T). It is safer to avoid using this device for high precision applications like bandgaps because the forward voltage variation is not measured by PCM test and therefore also the corner models will not be as accurate as needed for this purpose.
