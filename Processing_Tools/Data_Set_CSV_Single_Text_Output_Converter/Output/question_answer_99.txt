Question: Please explain the HW terminal on some devices.
Answer: Several transistors (e.g. nhvta, nhvtb, nhvu, ndhvt, ndhvta, phvta, phvtb and phvu) need a handle wafer connection for simulation. The fifth terminal 'HW' of these transistors is used for this. It is necessary to connect this terminal in schematic and layout. LVS checks this connection.

The connection of the handle wafer can be realized by a top side or a back side connection. In case of top side connection the HWC module is to be used. If the back side application is used or in case of the transistors nhvta, nhvtb, nhvu, ndhvt, ndhvta, phvta, phvtb and phvu, an auxiliary handle wafer contact is necessary in the layout view. The auxiliary handle wafer contact is only used for LVS and simulation, no mask will be created.

The xt018-ApplicationNote-Layout_Techniques document explains how to create an auxiliary handle wafer contact in layout.
