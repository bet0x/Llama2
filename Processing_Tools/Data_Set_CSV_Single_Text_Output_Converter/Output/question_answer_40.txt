Question: Assura gives background stamp errors. What exactly are these?
Answer: The bkgnd_StampErrorFloat error simply means that the layout being checked has no connection to the substrate. Placing even just a single PDIFF contact will clear the error (of course such would not be sufficient for an entire chip).
The bkgnd_StampErrorMult and bkgnd_StampErrorConnect errors work together to indicate that the layout has multiple substrate connections that are not connected to the same node with metal (resulting in soft connections through the substrate). Assura will flag one of the connections (stamps) with bkgnd_StampErrorMult and all of the others with bkgnd_StampErrorConnect.
