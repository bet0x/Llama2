Question: Can I ignore DRC errors on my logo elements?
Answer: Although a logo strucure is not a circuit element, it can be very dangerous, in some cases, to waive logo DRC errors. For example, metals and/or photo-resist that are below minimum width may float off the silicon during the processing and then get deposited elsewhere on the design and cause chip failures.
