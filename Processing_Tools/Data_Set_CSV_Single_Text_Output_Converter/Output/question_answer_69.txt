Question: Can X-FAB provide IBIS models?
Answer: X-FAB does not support IBIS models. This falls beyond the scope of X-FAB's modelling and library support, as we are a pure-play wafer manufacturer.
As I understand it, the IBIS model provides I/O device characteristics through V/I data and switching characteristics in ASCII format. The IBIS models are meant for the transfer of data and not to define an executable simulation model. They are component specific, which means that they model an entire component (e.g. an FPGA) and not just a particular I/O.
IBIS models are supposed to serve for implementing the behavior of I/Os into a technology independent PCB level EMC simulation environment. We cannot provide correct IBIS models since we don't have all the required package and pin related data. I/O cell characteristics are available in data sheets, Verilog models and especially the timing (Liberty format) files, which you could use to generate the switching characteristic for an IBIS model.
